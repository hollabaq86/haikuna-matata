---need to install virtualenv so you can access the proper virtual environment
$ sudo -H pip install virtualenv

---need to install autoenv so the virtual environment can auto load when we are done
$ pip install autoenv==1.0.0

---need to specify the folder that you want to access to use the proper virtual environment
$ source env/bin/activate

---Lastly need to enter the following to update your local bash so it auto loads the environment whenever you enter the project directory
$ echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc


---when you are ready to leave the env for our project, just type the following
$ deactivate


---below is a link for deployment options

******NOTE******
if the auto load environment doesnt work, just enter the source env/bin/activate form the command line to load the proper environment
