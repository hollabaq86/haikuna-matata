THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER
PART ONE
 August 25, 1991 Dear friend,
 I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that
person at that party even though you could have. Please don’t try to figure out who she is because
then you might figure out who I am, and I really don’t want you to do that. I will call people by
different names or generic names because I don’t want you to find me. I didn’t enclose a return address
for the same reason. I mean nothing bad by this. Honest.
 I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn’t try to sleep with
people even if they could have. I need to know that these people exist.
 I think you of all people would understand that because I think you of all people are alive and
appreciate what that means. At least I hope you do because other people look to you for strength
and friendship and it’s that simple. At least that’s what I’ve heard.
 So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to
figure out how that could be.
 I try to think of my family as a reason for me being this way, especially after my friend Michael
stopped going to school one day last spring and we heard Mr. Vaughn’s voice on the loudspeaker.
 “Boys and girls, I regret to inform you that one of our students has passed on. We will hold a
memorial service for Michael Dobson during assembly this Friday.”
 I don’t know how news travels around school and why it is very often right. Maybe it was in the
lunchroom. It’s hard to remember. But Dave with the awkward glasses told us that Michael killed
himself. His mom played bridge with one of Michael’s neighbors and they heard the gunshot.
 I don’t really remember much of what happened after that except that my older brother came
to Mr. Vaughn’s office in my middle school and told me to stop crying. Then, he put his arm on
my shoulder and told me to get it out of my system before Dad came home. We then went to eat
french fries at McDonald’s and he taught me how to play pinball. He even made a joke that because
of me he got to skip an afternoon of school and asked me if I wanted to help him work on
his Camaro. I guess I was pretty messy because he never let me work on his Camaro before.
 At the guidance counselor sessions, they asked the few of us who actually liked Michael to say a
few words. I think they were afraid that some of us would try to kill ourselves or something because
they looked very tense and one of them kept touching his beard.
 Bridget who is crazy said that sometimes she thought about suicide when commercials come on
during TV. She was sincere and this puzzled the guidance counselors. Carl who is nice to everyone
said that he felt very sad, but could never kill himself because it is a sin.
 This one guidance counselor went through the whole group and finally came to me.
 “What do you think, Charlie?”
 What was so strange about this was the fact that I had never met this man because he was a
5
“specialist” and he knew my name even though I wasn’t wearing a name tag like they do in open
house.
 “Well, I think that Michael was a nice guy and I don’t understand why he did it. As much as I
feel sad, I think that not knowing is what really bothers me.”
 I just reread that and it doesn’t sound like how I talk. Especially in that office because I was crying
still. I never did stop crying.
 The counselor said that he suspected that Michael had “problems at home” and didn’t feel like
he had anyone to talk to. That’s maybe why he felt all alone and killed himself.
 Then, I started screaming at the guidance counselor that Michael could have talked to me. And
I started crying even harder. He tried to calm me down by saying that he meant an adult like a
teacher or a guidance counselor. But it didn’t work and eventually my brother came by the middle
school in his Camaro to pick me up.
 For the rest of the school year, the teachers treated me different and gave me better grades even
though I didn’t get any smarter. To tell you the truth, I think I made them all nervous.
 Michael’s funeral was strange because his father didn’t cry. And three months later he left Michael’s
mom. At least according to Dave at lunchtime. I think about it sometimes. I wonder what
went on in Michael’s house around dinner and TV shows. Michael never left a note or at least his
parents didn’t let anyone see it. Maybe it was “problems at home.” I wish I knew. It might make
me miss him more clearly. It might have made sad sense.
 One thing I do know is that it makes me wonder if I have “problems at home” but it seems to
me that a lot of other people have it a lot worse. Like when my sister’s first boyfriend started going
around with another girl and my sister cried for the whole weekend.
 My dad said, “There are other people who have it a lot worse.”
 And my mom was quiet. And that was that. A month later, my sister met another boy and
started playing happy records again. And my dad kept working. And my mom kept sweeping.
And my brother kept fixing his Camaro. That is, until he left for college at the beginning of the
summer. He’s playing football for Penn State but he needed the summer to get his grades right to
play football.
 I don’t think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest.
My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very
pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle. I get straight A’s now like my sister and that is
why they leave me alone.
 My mom cries a lot during TV programs. My dad works a lot and is an honest man. My Aunt
Helen used to say that my dad was going to be too proud to have a midlife crisis. It took me until
around now to understand what she meant by that because he just turned forty and nothing has
changed.
 My Aunt Helen was my favorite person in the whole world. She was my mom’s sister. She got
straight A’s when she was a teenager and she used to give me books to read. My father said that the
books were a little too old for me, but I liked them so he just shrugged and let me read.
6
 My Aunt Helen lived with the family for the last few years of her life because something very
bad happened to her. Nobody would tell me what happened then even though I always wanted to
know. When I was around seven, I stopped asking about it because I kept asking like kids always
do and my Aunt Helen started crying very hard.
 That’s when my dad slapped me, saying, “You’re hurting your aunt Helen’s feelings!” I didn’t
want to do that, so I stopped. Aunt Helen told my father not to hit me in front of her ever again
and my father said this was his house and he would do what he wanted and my mom was quiet and
so were my brother and sister.
 I don’t remember much more than that because I started crying really hard and after a while my
dad had my mom take me to my room. It wasn’t until much later that my mom had a few glasses
of white wine and told me what happened to her sister. Some people really do have it a lot worse
than I do. They really do.
 I should probably go to sleep now. It’s very late. I don’t know why I wrote a lot of this down
for you to read. The reason I wrote this letter is because I start high school tomorrow and I am really
afraid of going.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 September 7, 1991 Dear friend,
 I do not like high school. The cafeteria is called the “Nutrition Center,” which is strange. There
is this one girl in my advanced english class named Susan. In middle school, Susan was very fun
to be around. She liked movies, and her brother Frank made her tapes of this great music that
she shared with us. But over the summer she had her braces taken off, and she got a little taller
and prettier and grew breasts. Now, she acts a lot dumber in the hallways, especially when boys are
around. And I think it’s sad because Susan doesn’t look as happy. To tell you the truth, she doesn’t
like to admit she’s in the advanced english class, and she doesn’t like to say “hi” to me in the hall
anymore.
 When Susan was at the guidance counselor meeting about Michael, she said that Michael once
told her that she was the prettiest girl in the whole world, braces and all. Then, he asked her to “go
with him,” which was a big deal at any school. They call it “going out” in high school. And they
kissed and talked about movies, and she missed him terribly because he was her best friend.
 It’s funny, too, because boys and girls normally weren’t best friends around my school. But
Michael and Susan were. Kind of like my Aunt Helen and me. I’m sorry. “My Aunt Helen and I.”
That’s one thing I learned this week. That and more consistent punctuation.
 I keep quiet most of the time, and only one kid named Sean really seemed to notice me. He
waited for me after gym class and said really immature things like how he was going to give me a
“swirlie,” which is where someone sticks your head in the toilet and flushes to make your hair swirl
around. He seemed pretty unhappy as well, and I told him so. Then, he got mad and started hit-
7
ting me, and I just did the things my brother taught me to do. My brother is a very good fighter.
 “Go for the knees, throat, and eyes.”
 And I did. And I really hurt Sean. And then I started crying. And my sister had to leave her senior
honors class and drive me home. I got called to Mr. Small’s office, but I didn’t get suspended
or anything because a kid told Mr. Small the truth about the fight.
 “Sean started it. It was self-defense.”
 And it was. I just don’t understand why Sean wanted to hurt me. I didn’t do anything to him. I
am very small. That’s true. But I guess Sean didn’t know I could fight. The truth is I could have
hurt him a lot worse. And maybe I should have. I thought I might have to if he came after the kid
who told Mr. Small the truth, but Sean never did go after him. So, everything was forgotten.
 Some kids look at me strange in the hallways because I don’t decorate my locker, and I’m the
one who beat up Sean and couldn’t stop crying after he did it. I guess I’m pretty emotional.
 It has been very lonely because my sister is busy being the oldest one in our family. My brother
is busy being a football player at Penn State. After the training camp, his coach said that he was
second string and that when he starts learning the system, he will be first string.
 My dad really hopes he will make it to the pros and play for the Steelers. My mom is just glad
he gets to go to college for free because my sister doesn’t play football, and there wouldn’t be
enough money to send both of them. That’s why she wants me to keep working hard, so I’ll get an
academic scholarship.
 So, that’s what I’m doing until I meet a friend here. I was hoping that the kid who told the truth
could become a friend of mine, but I think he was just being a good guy by telling.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 September 11, 1991 Dear friend,
 I don’t have a lot of time because my advanced english teacher assigned us a book to read, and
I like to read books twice. Incidentally, the book is To Kill a Mockingbird. If you haven’t read it, I
think you should because it is very interesting. The teacher has assigned us a few chapters at a time,
but I do not like to read books like that. I am halfway through the first time.
 Anyway, the reason I am writing to you is because I saw my brother on television. I normally
don’t like sports too much, but this was a special occasion. My mother started crying, and my father
put his arm around her shoulder, and my sister smiled, which is funny because my brother and
sister always fight when he’s around.
 But my older brother was on television, and so far, it has been the highlight of my two weeks in
high school. I miss him terribly, which is strange, because we never really talked much when he was
here. We still don’t talk, to be honest.
 I would tell you his position, but like I said, I would like to be anonymous to you. I hope you
8
understand.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 September 16, 1991 Dear friend,
 I have finished To Kill a Mockingbird. It is now my favorite book of all time, but then again,
I always think that until I read another book. My advanced english teacher asked me to call him
“Bill” when we’re not in class, and he gave me another book to read. He says that I have a great
skill at reading and understanding language, and he wanted me to write an essay about To Kill a
Mockingbird.
 I mentioned this to my mom, and she asked why Bill didn’t recommend that I just take a sophomore
or junior english class. And I told her that Bill said that these were basically the same classes
with more complicated books, and that it wouldn’t help me. My mom said that she wasn’t sure and
would talk to him during open house. Then, she asked me to help her by washing the dishes, which
I did.
 Honestly, I don’t like doing dishes. I like eating with my fingers and off napkins, but my sister
says that doing so is bad for the environment. She is a part of the Earth Day Club here in high
school, and that is where she meets the boys. They are all very nice to her, and I don’t really understand
why except maybe the fact that she is pretty. She really is mean to these boys.
 One boy has it particularly hard. I won’t tell you his name. But I will tell you all about him. He
has very nice brown hair, and he wears it long with a ponytail. I think he will regret this when he
looks back on his life. He is always making mix tapes for my sister with very specific themes. One
was called “Autumn Leaves.” He included many songs by the Smiths. He even hand-colored the
cover. After the movie he rented was over, and he left, my sister gave me the tape.
 “Do you want this, Charlie?”
 I took the tape, but I felt weird about it because he had made it for her. But I listened to it.
And loved it very much. There is one song called “Asleep” that I would like you to listen to. I told
my sister about it. And a week later she thanked me because when this boy asked her about the
tape, she said exactly what I said about the song “Asleep,” and this boy was very moved by how
much it meant to her. I hope this means I will be good at dating when the time comes.
 I should stick to the subject, though. That is what my teacher Bill tells me to do because I write
kind of the way I talk. I think that is why he wants me to write that essay about To Kill a Mockingbird.
 This boy who likes my sister is always respectful to my parents. My mom likes him very much
because of this. My dad thinks he’s soft. I think that’s why my sister does what she does to him.
 This one night, she was saying very mean things about how he didn’t stand up to the class bully
when he was fifteen or something like that. To tell you the truth, I was just watching the movie he
had rented, so I wasn’t paying very close attention to their fight. They fight all the time, so I figured
9
that the movie was at least something different, which it wasn’t because it was a sequel.
 Anyway, after she leaned into him for about four movie scenes, which I guess is about ten minutes
or so, he started crying. Crying very hard. Then, I turned around, and my sister pointed at me.
 “You see. Even Charlie stood up to his bully. You see.”
 And this guy got really red-faced. And he looked at me. Then, he looked at her. And he
wound up and hit her hard across the face. I mean hard. I just froze because I couldn’t believe he
did it. It was not like him at all to hit anybody. He was the boy that made mix tapes with themes
and hand-colored covers until he hit my sister and stopped crying.
 The weird part is that my sister didn’t do anything. She just looked at him very quietly. It was
so weird. My sister goes crazy if you eat the wrong kind of tuna, but here was this guy hitting her,
and she didn’t say anything. She just got soft and nice. And she asked me to leave, which I did.
After the boy had left, she said that they were “going out” and not to tell mom or dad what happened.
 I guess he stood up to his bully. And I guess that makes sense.
 That weekend, my sister spent a lot of time with this boy. And they laughed a lot more than
they usually did. On Friday night, I was reading my new book, but my brain got tired, so I decided
to watch some television instead. And I opened the door to the basement, and my sister and this
boy were naked.
 He was on top of her, and her legs were draped over either side of the couch. And she
screamed at me in a whisper.
 “Get out. You pervert.”
 So, I left. The next day, we all watched my brother play football. And my sister invited this boy
over. I am not sure when he left the previous night. They held hands and acted like everything
was happy. And this boy said something about how the football team hasn’t been the same since
my brother graduated, and my dad thanked him. And when the boy left, my dad said that this boy
was becoming a fine young man who could carry himself. And my mom was quiet. And my sister
looked at me to make sure I wouldn’t say anything. And that was that.
 “Yes. He is.” That’s all my sister could say. And I could see this boy at home doing his homework
and thinking about my sister naked. And I could see them holding hands at football games
that they do not watch. And I could see this boy throwing up in the bushes at a party house. And
I could see my sister putting up with it.
 And I felt very bad for both of them.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 September 18, 1991 Dear friend,
 I never told you that I am in shop class, did I? Well, I am in shop class, and it is my favorite class
10
next to Bill’s advanced english class. I wrote the essay for To Kill a Mockingbird last night, and I
handed it in to Bill this morning. We are supposed to talk about it tomorrow during lunch period.
 The point, though, is that there is a guy in shop class named “Nothing.” I’m not kidding. His
name is “Nothing.” And he is hilarious. “Nothing” got his name when kids used to tease him in
middle school. I think he’s a senior now. The kids started calling him Patty when his real name is
Patrick. And “Nothing” told these kids, “Listen, you either call me Patrick, or you call me nothing.”
 So, the kids started calling him “Nothing.” And the name just stuck. He was a new kid in the
school district at the time because his dad married a new woman in this area. I think I will stop
putting quotation marks around Nothing’s name because it is annoying and disrupting my flow. I
hope you do not find this difficult to follow. I will make sure to differentiate if something comes
up.
 So, in shop class Nothing started to do a very funny impersonation of our teacher, Mr. Callahan.
He even painted in the muttonchop sideburns with a grease pencil. Hilarious. When Mr.
Callahan found Nothing doing this near the belt sander, he actually laughed because Nothing wasn’t
doing the impersonation mean or anything. It was just that funny. I wish you could have been
there because it was the hardest I’ve laughed since my brother left. My brother used to tell Polish
jokes, which I know is wrong, but I just blocked out the Polish part and listened to the jokes. Hilarious.
 Oh, incidentally, my sister asked for her “Autumn Leaves” mix tape back. She listens to it all the
time now.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 September 29, 1991 Dear friend,
 There is a lot to tell you about the last two weeks. A lot of it is good, but a lot of it is bad.
Again, I don’t know why this always happens.
 First of all, Bill gave me a C on my To Kill a Mockingbird essay because he said that I run my
sentences together. I am trying now to practice not to do that. He also said that I should use the
vocabulary words that I learn in class like “corpulent” and “jaundice.” I would use them here, but I
really don’t think they are appropriate in this format.
 To tell you the truth, I don’t know where they are appropriate to use. I’m not saying that you
shouldn’t know them. You should absolutely. But I just have never heard anyone use the words
“corpulent” and “jaundice” ever in my life. That includes teachers. So, what’s the point of using
words nobody else knows or can say comfortably? I just don’t understand that.
 I feel the same way about some movie stars who are terrible to watch. Some of these people
must have a million dollars at least, and yet, they keep doing these movies. They blow up bad guys.
They yell at their detectives. They do interviews for magazines. Every time I see this one particular
movie star on a magazine, I can’t help but feel terribly sorry for her because nobody respects her at
11
all, and yet they keep interviewing her. And the interviews all say the same thing.
 They start with what food they are eating in some restaurant. “As ---- gingerly munched her
Chinese Chicken Salad, she spoke of love.” And all the covers say the same thing: “---- gets to the
bottom of stardom, love, and hissther hit new moviesttelevision showstalbum.”
 I think it’s nice for stars to do interviews to make us think they are just like us, but to tell you the
truth, I get the feeling that it’s all a big lie. The problem is I don’t know who’s lying. And I don’t
know why these magazines sell as much as they do. And I don’t know why the ladies in the dentist’s
office like them as much as they do. A Saturday ago, I was in the dentist’s office, and I heard
this conversation.
 “Did you see that movie?” as she points to the cover.
 “I did. I saw it with Harold.”
 “What do you think?”
 “She is just lovely.”
 “Yeah. She is.”
 “Oh, I have this new recipe.”
 “Low-fat?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Do you have some time tomorrow?”
 “No. Why don’t you have Mike fax it to Harold?”
 “Okay.”
 Then, these ladies started talking about the one star I mentioned before, and they both had very
strong opinions.
 “I think it’s disgraceful.”
 “Did you read the interview in Good Housekeeping?”
 “A few months back?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Disgraceful.”
 “Did you read the one in Cosmopolitan?”
 “No.”
 “God, it was practically the same interview.”
 “I don’t know why they give her the time of day.”
 The fact that one of these ladies was my mom made me feel particularly sad because my mom
is beautiful. And she’s always on a diet. Sometimes, my dad calls her beautiful, but she cannot hear
him. Incidentally, my dad is a very good husband. He’s just pragmatic.
 After the dentist’s office, my mom drove me to the cemetery where a lot of her relatives are
12
buried. My dad does not like to go to the cemetery because it gives him the creeps. But I don’t
mind going at all because my Aunt Helen is buried there. My mom was always the pretty one, as
they say, and my Aunt Helen was always the other one. The nice thing was my Aunt Helen was
never on a diet. And my Aunt Helen was “corpulent.” Hey, I did it!
 My Aunt Helen would always let us kids stay up and watch Saturday Night Live when she was
baby-sitting or when she was living with us and my parents went to another couple’s house to get
drunk and play board games. When I was very little, I remember going to sleep, while my brother
and sister and Aunt Helen watched Love Boat and Fantasy Island. I could never stay awake when
I was that little, and I wish I could, because my brother and sister talk about those moments sometimes.
Maybe it’s sad that these are now memories. And maybe it’s not sad. And maybe it’s just the
fact that we loved Aunt Helen, especially me, and this was the time we could spend with her.
 I won’t start listing television episode memories, except one because I guess we’re on the subject,
and it seems like something everyone can relate to in a small way. And since I don’t know you,
I figure that maybe I can write about something that you can relate to.
 The family was sitting around, watching the final episode of More”inA”inSo”inHave, and I’ll
never forget it even though I was very young. My mom was crying. My sister was crying. My
brother was using every ounce of strength he had not to cry. And my dad left during one of the final
moments to make a sandwich. Now, I don’t remember much about the program itself because
I was too young, but my dad never left to make a sandwich except during commercial breaks, and
then he usually just sent my mom. I walked to the kitchen, and I saw my dad making a sandwich ...
and crying. He was crying harder than even my mom. And I couldn’t believe it. When he finished
making his sandwich, he put away the things in the refrigerator and stopped crying and wiped his
eyes and saw me.
 Then, he walked up, patted my shoulder, and said, “This is our little secret, okay, champ?”
 “Okay,” I said.
 And Dad picked me up with the arm that wasn’t holding the sandwich, and carried me to the
room that had the television, and put me on his lap for the rest of the television episode. At the
end of the episode, he picked me up, turned off the TV, and turned around.
 And my dad declared, “That was a great series.”
 And my mom said, “The best.”
 And my sister asked, “How long was it on the air?”
 And my brother replied, “Nine years, stupid.”
 And my sister responded, “You ... stupid.”
 And my dad said, “Stop it, right now.”
 And my mom said, “Listen to your father.”
 And my brother said nothing.
 And my sister said nothing.
 And years later I found out my brother was wrong.
13
 I went to the library to look up the figures, and I found out that the episode we watched is the
highest watched anything of television history, which I find amazing because it felt like just the five
of us.
 You know ... a lot of kids at school hate their parents. Some of them got hit. And some of
them got caught in the middle of wrong lives. Some of them were trophies for their parents to
show the neighbors like ribbons or gold stars. And some of them just wanted to drink in peace.
 For me personally, as much as I don’t understand my mom and dad and as much as I feel sorry
for both of them sometimes, I can’t help but love them very much. My mom drives to visit the
cemetery of people she loves. My dad cried during More”inA”inSo”inHave, and trusted me to
keep his secret, and let me sit on his lap, and called me “champ.”
 Incidentally, I only have one cavity, and as much as my dentist asks me to, I just can’t bring myself
to floss.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 October 6, 1991 Dear friend,
 I feel very ashamed. I went to the high school football game the other day, and I don’t know
exactly why. In middle school, Michael and I would go to the games sometimes even though neither
of us were popular enough to go. It was just a place to go on Fridays when we didn’t want to
watch television. Sometimes, we would see Susan there, and she and Michael would hold hands.
 But this time, I went alone because Michael is gone, and Susan hangs around different boys now,
and Bridget is still crazy, and Carl’s mom sent him to a Catholic school, and Dave with the awkward
glasses moved away. I was just kind of watching people, seeing who was in love and who was just
hanging around, and I saw that kid I told you about. Remember Nothing? Nothing was there at the
football game, and he was one of the few people who was not an adult that was actually watching
the game. I mean really watching the game. He would yell things out.
 “Can’mon, Brad!” That’s the name of our quarterback.
 Now, normally I am very shy, but Nothing seemed like the kind of guy you could just walk up to
at a football game even though you were three years younger and not popular.
 “Hey, you’re in my shop class!” He’s a very friendly person.
 “I’m Charlie.” I said, not too shy.
 “And I’m Patrick. And this is Sam.” He pointed to a very pretty girl next to him. And she
waved to me.
 “Hey, Charlie.” Sam had a very nice smile.
 They both told me to have a seat, and they both seemed to mean it, so I took a seat. I listened
to Nothing yell at the field. And I listened to his play-by-play analysis. And I figured out that this
was a kid who knew football very well. He actually knew football as well as my brother. Maybe
14
I should call Nothing “Patrick” from now on since that is how he introduced himself, and that is
what Sam calls him.
 Incidentally, Sam has brown hair and very very pretty green eyes. The kind of green that
doesn’t make a big deal about itself. I would have told you that sooner, but under the stadium
lights, everything looked kind of washed out. It wasn’t until we went to the Big Boy, and Sam and
Patrick started to chain-smoke that I got a good look at her. The nice thing about the Big Boy was
the fact that Patrick and Sam didn’t just throw around inside jokes and make me struggle to keep
up. Not at all. They asked me questions.
 “How old are you, Charlie?”
 “Fifteen.”
 “What do you want to do when you grow up?”
 “I don’t know just yet.”
 “What’s your favorite band?”
 “I think maybe the Smiths because I love their song `Asleep,’ but I’m really not sure one way or
the other because I don’t know any other songs by them too well.”
 “What’s your favorite movie?”
 “I don’t know really. They’re all the same to me.”
 “How about your favorite book?”
 “This Side of Paradise by From. Scott Fitzgerald.”
 “Why?”
 “Because it was the last one I read.”
 This made them laugh because they knew I meant it honest, not show-off. Then they told me
their favorites, and we sat quiet. I ate the pumpkin pie because the lady said it was in season, and
Patrick and Sam smoked more cigarettes.
 I looked at them, and they looked really happy together. A good kind of happy. And even
though I thought Sam was very pretty and nice, and she was the first girl I ever wanted to ask on a
date someday when I can drive, I did not mind that she had a boyfriend, especially if he was a good
guy like Patrick.
 “How long have you been `going out’?” I asked.
 Then, they started laughing. Really laughing hard.
 “What’s so funny?” I said.
 “We’re brother and sister,” Patrick said, still laughing.
 “But you don’t look alike,” I said.
 That’s when Sam explained that they were actually stepsister and stepbrother since Patrick’s dad
married Sam’s mom. I was very happy to know that because I would really like to ask Sam on a
date someday. I really would. She is so nice.
15
 I feel ashamed, though, because that night, I had a weird dream. I was with Sam. And we were
both naked. And her legs were spread over the sides of the couch. And I woke up. And I had
never felt that good in my life. But I also felt bad because I saw her naked without her permission.
I think that I should tell Sam about this, and I really hope it does not prevent us from maybe making
up inside jokes of our own. It would be very nice to have a friend again. I would like that even
more than a date.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 October 14, 1991 Dear friend,
 Do you know what “masturbation” is? I think you probably do because you are older than me.
But just in case, I will tell you. Masturbation is when you rub your genitals until you have an orgasm.
Wow!
 I thought that in those movies and television shows when they talk about having a coffee break
that they should have a masturbation break. But then again, I think this would decrease productivity.
 I’m only being cute here. I don’t really mean it. I just wanted to make you smile. I meant the
“wow” though.
 I told Sam that I dreamt that she and I were naked on the sofa, and I started crying because
I felt bad, and do you know what she did? She laughed. Not a mean laugh, either. A really nice,
warm laugh. She said that she thought I was being cute. And she said it was okay that I had a
dream about her. And I stopped crying. Sam then asked me if I thought she was pretty, and I told
her I thought she was “lovely.” Sam then looked me right in the eye.
 “You know you’re too young for me, Charlie? You do know that?”
 “Yes, I do.”
 “I don’t want you to waste your time thinking about me that way.”
 “I won’t. It was just a dream.”
 Sam then gave me a hug, and it was strange because my family doesn’t hug a lot except my Aunt
Helen. But after a few moments, I could smell Sam’s perfume, and I could feel her body against
me. And I stepped back.
 “Sam, I’m thinking about you that way.”
 She just looked at me and shook her head. Then, she put her arm around my shoulder and
walked me down the hallway. We met Patrick outside because they didn’t like to go to class sometimes.
They preferred to smoke.
 “Charlie has a Charlie-esque crush on me, Patrick.”
 “He does, huh?”
16
 “I’m trying not to,” I offered, which just made them laugh.
 Patrick then asked Sam to leave, which she did, and he explained some things to me, so I would
know how to be around other girls and not waste my time thinking about Sam that way.
 “Charlie, has anyone told you how it works?”
 “I don’t think so.”
 “Well, there are rules you follow here not because you want to, but because you have to. You
get it?”
 “I guess so.”
 “Okay. You take girls, for example. They’re copying their moms and magazines and everything
to know how to act around guys.”
 I thought about the moms and the magazines and the everythings, and the thought made me
nervous, especially if it includes TV.
 “I mean it’s not like in the movies where girls like assholes or anything like that. It’s not that
easy. They just like somebody that can give them a purpose.”
 “A purpose?”
 “Right. You know? Girls like guys to be a challenge. It gives them some mold to fit in how they
act. Like a mom. What would a mom do if she couldn’t fuss over you and make you clean your
room? And what would you do without her fussing and making you do it? Everyone needs a mom.
And a mom knows this. And it gives her a sense of purpose. You get it?”
 “Yeah,” I said even though I didn’t. But I got it enough to say “Yeah” and not be lying, though.
 “The thing is some girls think they can actually change guys. And what’s funny is that if they
actually did change them, they’d get bored. They’d have no challenge left. You just have to give
girls some time to think of a new way of doing things, that’s all. Some of them will figure it out
here. Some later. Some never. I wouldn’t worry about it too much.”
 But I guess I did worry about it. I’ve been worrying about it ever since he told me. I look
at people holding hands in the hallways, and I try to think about how it all works. At the school
dances, I sit in the background, and I tap my toe, and I wonder how many couples will dance to
“their song.” In the hallways, I see the girls wearing the guys’ jackets, and I think about the idea of
property. And I wonder if anyone is really happy. I hope they are. I really hope they are.
 Bill looked at me looking at people, and after class, he asked me what I was thinking about, and
I told him. He listened, and he nodded and made “affirmation” sounds. When I had finished, his
face changed into a “serious talk” face.
 “Do you always think this much, Charlie?”
 “Is that bad?” I just wanted someone to tell me the truth.
 “Not necessarily. It’s just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.”
 “Is that bad?”
 “Yes.”
17
 “I think I participate, though. Don’t you think I am?”
 “Well, are you dancing at these dances?”
 “I’m not a very good dancer.”
 “Are you going on dates?”
 “Well, I don’t have a car, and even if I did, I can’t drive because I’m fifteen, and anyway, I
haven’t met a girl I like except for Sam, but I am too young for her, and she would always have to
drive, which I don’t think is fair.”
 Bill smiled and continued asking me questions. Slowly, he got to “problems at home.” And I
told him about the boy who makes mix tapes hitting my sister because my sister only told me not to
tell mom or dad about it, so I figured I could tell Bill. He got this very serious look on his face after
I told him, and he said something to me I don’t think I will forget this semester or ever.
 “Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.”
 I just stood there, quiet. Bill patted my shoulder and gave me a new book to read. He told me
everything was going to be okay.
 I usually walk home from school because it makes me feel like I’ve earned it. What I mean is
that I want to be able to tell my kids that I walked to school like my grandparents did in the “old
days.” It’s odd that I’m planning this considering I’ve never had a date, but I guess that makes
sense. It usually takes me an extra hour or so to walk as opposed to taking the bus, but it’s worth it
when the weather is nice and cool like it was today.
 When I finally got home, my sister was sitting on a chair. My mom and my dad were standing
in front of her. And I knew that Bill had called home and told them. And I felt terrible. It was all
my fault.
 My sister was crying. My mom was very very quiet. My dad did all the talking. He said that my
sister was not allowed to see the boy who hit her anymore, and he was going to have a talk with the
boy’s parents tonight. My sister then said that it was all her fault, that she was provoking him, but
my dad said it was no excuse.
 “But I love him!” I had never seen my sister cry that much.
 “No, you don’t.”
 “I hate you!”
 “No, you don’t.” My dad can be very calm sometimes.
 “He’s my whole world.”
 “Don’t ever say that about anyone again. Not even me.” That was my mom.
 My mom chooses her battles carefully, and I can tell you one thing about my family. When my
mom does say something, she always gets her way. And this time was no exception. My sister
stopped crying immediately.
 After that, my dad gave my sister a rare kiss on the forehead. Then, he left the house, got in his
Oldsmobile, and drove away. I thought he probably was going to talk to the boy’s parents. And I
18
felt very sorry for them. `from
 parents, I mean. Because my dad doesn’t lose fights. He just doesn’t.
 My mom then went into the kitchen to make my sister’s favorite thing to eat, and my sister
looked at me.
 “I hate you.”
 My sister said it different than she said it to my dad. She meant it with me. She really did.
 “I love you,” was all I could say in return.
 “You’re a freak, you know that? You’ve always been a freak. Everyone says so. They always
have.”
 “I’m trying not to be.”
 Then, I turned around and walked to my room and closed my door and put my head under my
pillow and let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be.
 By the way, I figure you are probably curious about my dad. Did he hit us when we were kids
or now even? I just thought you might be curious because Bill was, after I told him about that boy
and my sister. Well, if you are wondering, he didn’t. He never touched my brother or sister. And
the only time he ever slapped me was when I made my Aunt Helen cry. And once we all calmed
down, he got on his knees in front of me and said that his stepdad hit him a lot, and he decided in
college when my mom got pregnant with my older brother that he would never hit his kids. And
he felt terrible for doing it. And he was so sorry. And he would never hit me again. And he hasn’t.
 He’s just stern sometimes.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 October 15, 1991 Dear friend,
 I guess I forgot to mention in my last letter that it was Patrick who told me about masturbation.
I guess I also forgot to tell you how often I do it now, which is a lot. I don’t like to look at pictures.
I just close my eyes and dream about a lady I do not know. And I try not to feel ashamed. I never
think about Sam when I do it. Never. That’s very important to me because I was so happy when
she said “Charlie-esque” since it felt like an inside joke of sorts.
 One night, I felt so guilty that I promised God that I would never do it again. So, I started using
blankets, but then the blankets hurt, so I started using pillows, but then the pillows hurt, so I went
back to normal. I wasn’t raised very religiously because my parents went to Catholic school, but I
do believe in God very much. I just never gave God a name, if you know what I mean. I hope I
haven’t let Him down regardless.
 Incidentally, my dad did have a serious talk with the boy’s parents. The boy’s mother was very
very angry and screamed at her son. The boy’s father kept quiet. And my dad didn’t get too per-
19
sonal with them. He didn’t tell them they did a “lousy job” raising their son or anything.
 As far as he was concerned, the only important thing was getting their help to keep their son
away from his daughter. Once that was settled, he left them to deal with their family and came
home to deal with his. At least that’s how he put it.
 The one thing I did ask my dad was about the boy’s problems at home. Whether or not he
thought the parents hit their son. He told me to mind my own business. Because he didn’t know
and would never ask and didn’t think it mattered.
 “Not everyone has a sob story, Charlie, and even if they do, it’s no excuse.”
 That’s all he said. And then we went to watch television.
 My sister is still mad at me, but my dad said I did the right thing. I hope that I did, but it’s hard
to tell sometimes.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 October 28, 1991 Dear friend,
 I’m sorry I haven’t written to you in a couple of weeks, but I have been trying to “participate”
like Bill said. It’s strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the
book. Also, when I write letters, I spend the next two days thinking about what I figured out in my
letters. I do not know if this is good or bad. Nevertheless, I am trying to participate.
 Incidentally, the book Bill gave me was Peter Pan by Just. More. Barrie. I know what you’re
thinking. The cartoon Peter Pan with the lost boys. The actual book is so much better than that.
It’s just about this boy who refuses to grow up, and when Wendy grows up, he feels very betrayed.
At least that’s what I got out of it. I think Bill gave me the book to teach me a lesson of some
kind.
 The good news is that I read the book, and because of its fantasy nature, I could not pretend
that I was in the book. That way I could participate and still read.
 In terms of my participation in things, I am trying to go to social events that they set up in my
school. It’s too late to join any clubs or anything like that, but I still try to go to the things that I
can. Things like the homecoming football game and dance, even if I don’t have a date.
 I cannot imagine that I will ever come home for a homecoming game after I leave here, but it
was fun to pretend that I was. I found Patrick and Sam sitting in their normal spot in the bleachers,
and I started acting like I hadn’t seen them in a year even though I had seen them that afternoon in
lunch when I ate my orange, and they smoked cigarettes.
 “Patrick, is that you? And Sam ... it’s been so long. Who’s winning? God, college is such a trial.
My professor is making me read twenty-seven books this weekend, and my girlfr needs me to paint
signs for her protest rally Tuesday. Let those administrators know we mean business. Dad is busy
with his golf swing, and Mom has her hands full with tennis. We must do this again. I would stay,
20
but I have to pick my sister up from her emotional workshop. She’s making real progress. Good to
see ya.”
 And then I walked away. I went down to the concession stand and bought three boxes of nachos
and a diet coke for Sam. When I returned, I sat down and gave Patrick and Sam the nachos
and Sam her diet coke. And Sam smiled. The great thing about Sam is that she doesn’t think I’m
crazy for pretending to do things. Patrick doesn’t either, but he was too busy watching the game
and screaming at Brad, the quarterback.
 Sam told me during the game that they were going over to their friend’s house later for a party.
Then, she asked me if I wanted to go, and I said yes because I had never been to a party before. I
had seen one at my house, though.
 My parents went to Ohio to see a very distant cousin get buried or married. I don’t remember
which. And they left my brother in charge of the house. He was sixteen at the time. My
brother used the opportunity to throw a big party with beer and everything. I was ordered to stay
in my room, which was okay because that’s where everyone kept their coats, and it was fun looking
through the stuff in their pockets. Every ten minutes or so, a drunk girl or boy would stumble
in my room to see if they could make out there or something. Then, they would see me and walk
away. That is, except for this one couple.
 This one couple, whom I was told later were very popular and in love, stumbled into my room
and asked if I minded them using it. I told them that my brother and sister said I had to stay here,
and they asked if they could use the room anyway with me still in it. I said I didn’t see why not, so
they closed the door and started kissing. Kissing very hard. After a few minutes, the boy’s hand
went up the girl’s shirt, and she started protesting.
 “Can’mon, Dave.”
 “What?”
 “The kid’s in here.”
 “It’s okay.”
 And the boy kept working up the girl’s shirt, and as much as she said no, he kept working it.
After a few minutes, she stopped protesting, and he pulled her shirt off, and she had a white bra on
with lace. I honestly didn’t know what to do by this point. Pretty soon, he took off her bra and
started to kiss her breasts. And then he put his hand down her pants, and she started moaning. I
think they were both very drunk. He reached to take off her pants, but she started crying really
hard, so he reached for his own. He pulled his pants and underwear down to his knees.
 “Please. Dave. No.”
 But the boy just talked soft to her about how good she looked and things like that, and she
grabbed his penis with her hands and started moving it. I wish I could describe this a little more
nicely without using words like penis, but that was the way it was.
 After a few minutes, the boy pushed the girl’s head down, and she started to kiss his penis. She
was still crying. Finally, she stopped crying because he put his penis in her mouth, and I don’t think
you can cry in that position. I had to stop watching at that point because I started to feel sick, but
21
it kept going on, and they kept doing other things, and she kept saying “no.” Even when I covered
my ears, I could still hear her say that.
 My sister came in eventually to bring me a bowl of potato chips, and when she found the boy
and the girl, they stopped. My sister was very embarrassed, but not as embarrassed as the girl. The
boy looked kind of smug. He didn’t say much. After they left, my sister turned to me.
 “Did they know you were in here?”
 “Yes. They asked if they could use the room.”
 “Why didn’t you stop them?”
 “I didn’t know what they were doing.”
 “You pervert,” was the last thing my sister said before she left the room, still carrying the bowl
of potato chips.
 I told Sam and Patrick about this, and they both got very quiet. Sam said that she used to go
out with Dave for a while before she got into punk music, and Patrick said he heard about that
party. I wasn’t surprised that he did because it kind of became a legend. At least that’s what I’ve
heard when I tell some kids who my older brother is.
 When the police came, they found my brother asleep on the roof. Nobody knows how he got
there. My sister was making out in the laundry room with some senior. She was a freshman at the
time. A lot of parents came to the house then to pick up their kids, and a lot of the girls were crying
and throwing up. Most of the boys had run away by this point. My brother got in big trouble,
and my sister was given a “serious talk” by my parents about bad influences. And that was that.
 The boy named Dave is a senior now. He plays on the football team. He is a wide receiver. I
watched the end of the game when Dave caught a touchdown thrown from Brad. It ended up winning
the game for our school. And people went crazy in the stands because we won the game. But
all I could think about was that party. I thought about it quiet for a long time, then I looked over to
Sam.
 “He raped her, didn’t he?”
 She just nodded. I couldn’t tell if she was sad or just knew more things than me.
 “We should tell someone, shouldn’t we?”
 Sam just shook her head this time. She then explained about all the things you have to go
through to prove it, especially in high school when the boy and girl are popular and still in love.
 The next day at the homecoming dance, I saw them dancing together. Dave and his girl. And
I got really mad. It kind of scared me how mad I got. I thought about walking up to Dave and
really hurting him like maybe I should have really hurt Sean. And I think I would have, but Sam
saw me and put her arm around my shoulder like she does. She calmed me down, and I guess I’m
glad she did because I think I would have gotten even madder if I started hitting Dave, and his girl
stopped me because she loved him. I think I would have gotten even madder about that.
 So, I decided to do the next best thing and let the air out of Dave’s tires. Sam knew which was
his car.
22
 There is a feeling that I had Friday night after the homecoming game that I don’t know if I will
ever be able to describe except to say that it is warm. Sam and Patrick drove me to the party that
night, and I sat in the middle of Sam’s pickup truck. Sam loves her pickup truck because I think it
reminds her of her dad. The feeling I had happened when Sam told Patrick to find a station on the
radio. And he kept getting commercials. And commercials. And a really bad song about love that
had the word “baby” in it. And then more commercials. And finally he found this really amazing
song about this boy, and we all got quiet.
 Sam tapped her hand on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air
waves. And I just sat between them. After the song finished, I said something.
 “I feel infinite.”
 And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I said the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the
song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were
truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. I have since bought the record, and I would tell you
what it was, but truthfully, it’s not the same unless you’re driving to your first real party, and you’re
sitting in the middle seat of a pickup with two nice people when it starts to rain.
 We got to the house where the party was, and Patrick did this secret knock. It would be hard to
describe to you this knock without sound. The door opened a crack, and this guy with frizzy hair
looked out at us.
 “Patrick known as Patty known as Nothing?”
 “Bob.”
 The door opened, and the old friends hugged each other. Then, Sam and Bob hugged each
other. Then, Sam spoke.
 “This is our friend, Charlie.”
 And you won’t believe it. Bob hugged me! Sam told me as we were hanging up our coats that
Bob was “baked like a fucking cake.” I really had to quote that one even though it has a swear.
 The party was in the basement of this house. The room was quite smoky, and the kids were
much older. There were two girls showing each other their tattoos and belly button rings. Seniors,
I think.
 This guy named Fritz something was eating a lot of Twinkies. Fritz’s girlfr was talking to him
about women’s rights, and he kept saying, “I know, baby.”
 Sam and Patrick started smoking cigarettes. Bob went up to the kitchen when he heard the bell
ring. When he came back, he brought a can of Milwaukee’s Best beer for everyone, as well as two
new party guests. There was Maggie, who needed to use the bathroom. And there was Brad, the
quarterback of the high school football team. No kidding!
 I do not know why this excited me, but I guess when you see somebody in the hallway or on the
field or something, it’s nice to know that they are a real person.
 Everyone was very friendly to me and asked me a lot of questions about myself. I guess because
I was the youngest, and they didn’t want me to feel out of place, especially after I said no to
having a beer. I once had a beer with my brother when I was twelve, and I just didn’t like it. It’s
23
really that simple for me.
 Some of the questions I was asked was what grade I was in and what did I want to be when I
grow up.
 “I am a freshman, and I don’t know just yet.”
 I looked around, and I saw that Sam and Patrick had left with Brad. That’s when Bob started
passing around food.
 “Would you like a brownie?”
 “Yes. Thank you.”
 I was actually quite hungry because normally Sam and Patrick take me to the Big Boy after the
football games, and I guess I was used to it by now. I ate the brownie, and it tasted a little weird,
but it was still a brownie, so I still liked it. But this was not an ordinary brownie. Since you are
older, I think you know what kind of brownie it was.
 After thirty minutes, the room started to slip away from me. I was talking to one of the girls
with the belly button ring, and she seemed like she was in a movie. I started blinking a lot and
looking around, and the music sounded heavy like water.
 Sam came down and when she saw me, she turned to Bob.
 “What the hell is your problem?”
 “Come on, Sam. He likes it. Ask him.”
 “How do you feel, Charlie?”
 “Light.”
 “You see?” Bob actually looked a little nervous, which I was later told was paranoia.
 Sam sat down next to me and held my hand, which felt cool.
 “Are you seeing anything, Charlie?”
 “Light.”
 “Does it feel good?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Are you thirsty?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “What would you like to drink?”
 “A milkshake.”
 And everyone in the room, except Sam, erupted in laughter.
 “He’s stoned.”
 “Are you hungry, Charlie?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “What would you like to eat?”
24
 “A milkshake.”
 I don’t think they would have laughed any harder even if what I said was at all funny. Then,
Sam took my hand and stood me up on the dizzy floor.
 “Can’mon. We’ll get you a milkshake.”
 As we were leaving, Sam turned to Bob.
 “I still think you’re an asshole.”
 All Bob did was laugh. And Sam finally laughed, too. And I was glad that everyone seemed as
happy as they seemed.
 Sam and I got up to the kitchen, and she turned on the light. Wow! It was so bright, I couldn’t
believe it. It was like when you see a movie in the theater during the day, and when you leave the
movie, you can’t believe that it’s still daylight outside. Sam got some ice cream and some milk and a
blender. I asked her where the bathroom was, and she pointed around the corner almost like it was
her house. I think she and Patrick spent a lot of time here when Bob was still in high school.
 When I got out of the bathroom, I heard a noise in the room where we left our coats. I opened
the door, and I saw Patrick kissing Brad. It was a stolen type of kissing. They heard me in the
door and turned around. Patrick spoke first.
 “Is that you, Charlie?”
 “Sam’s making me a milkshake.”
 “Who is this kid?” Brad just looked real nervous and not in the Bob way.
 “He’s a friend of mine. Relax.”
 Patrick then took me out of the room and closed the door. He put his hands on both of my
shoulders and looked me straight in the eye.
 “Brad doesn’t want people to know.”
 “Why?”
 “Because he’s scared.”
 “Why?”
 “Because he is ... wait ... are you stoned?”
 “They said I was downstairs. Sam is making me a milkshake.”
 Patrick tried to keep from laughing.
 “Listen, Charlie. Brad doesn’t want people to know. I need you to promise that you won’t tell
anyone. This will be our little secret. Okay?”
 “Okay.”
 “Thanks.”
 With that, Patrick turned around and went back into the room. I heard some muffled voices,
and Brad seemed upset, but I didn’t think it was any of my business, so I went back to the kitchen.
 I have to say that it was the best milkshake I ever had in my life. It was so delicious, it almost
25
scared me.
 Before we left the party, Sam played me a few of her favorite songs. One was called “Blackbird.”
The other was called “MLK.” They were both very beautiful. I mentioned the titles because
they were as great when I listened to them sober.
 Another interesting thing happened at the party before we left. Patrick came downstairs. I
guess Brad had left. And Patrick smiled. And Bob started to make fun of him having a crush on
the quarterback. And Patrick smiled more. I don’t think I ever saw Patrick smile so much. Then,
Patrick pointed at me, and said something to Bob.
 “He’s something, isn’t he?”
 Bob nodded his head. Patrick then said something I don’t think I’ll ever forget.
 “He’s a wallflower.”
 And Bob really nodded his head. And the whole room nodded their head. And I started to feel
nervous in the Bob way, but Patrick didn’t let me get too nervous. He sat down next to me.
 “You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.”
 I didn’t know that other people thought things about me. I didn’t know that they looked. I was
sitting on the floor of a basement of my first real party between Sam and Patrick, and I remembered
that Sam introduced me as her friend to Bob. And I remembered that Patrick had done the
same for Brad. And I started to cry. And nobody in that room looked at me weird for doing it.
And then I really started to cry.
 Bob raised his drink and asked everyone to do the same.
 “To Charlie.”
 And the whole group said, “To Charlie.”
 I didn’t know why they did that, but it was very special to me that they did. Especially Sam.
Especially her.
 I would tell you more about the homecoming dance, but now that I’m thinking about it, me letting
out the air of Dave’s tires was the best part. I did try to dance like Bill suggested, but I usually
like songs you can’t dance to, so I didn’t do it too much. Sam did look very pretty in her dress, but
I was trying not to notice because I’m trying not to think of her that way.
 I did notice that Brad and Patrick never talked once during the whole dance because Brad was
off dancing with a cheerleader named Nancy, who is his girlfr. And I did notice that my sister
was dancing with the boy she wasn’t supposed to even though a different boy picked her up at the
house.
 After the dance, we left in Sam’s pickup. Patrick was driving this time. As we were approaching
the Fort Pitt Tunnel, Sam asked Patrick to pull to the side of the road. I didn’t know what was going
on. Sam then climbed in the back of the pickup, wearing nothing but her dance dress. She told
Patrick to drive, and he got this smile on his face. I guess they had done this before.
 Anyway, Patrick started driving really fast, and just before we got to the tunnel, Sam stood
up, and the wind turned her dress into ocean waves. When we hit the tunnel, all the sound got
26
scooped up into a vacuum, and it was replaced by a song on the tape player. A beautiful song
called “Landslide.” When we got out of the tunnel, Sam screamed this really fun scream, and there
it was. Downtown. Lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. Sam sat down and
started laughing. Patrick started laughing. I started laughing.
 And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 Part 2
 November 7, 1991 Dear friend,
 It was one of those days that I didn’t mind going to school because the weather was so pretty.
The sky was overcast with clouds, and the air felt like a warm bath. I don’t think I ever felt that
clean before. When I got home, I had to mow the lawn for my allowance, and I didn’t mind one
bit. I just listened to the music, and breathed in the day, and remembered things. Things like walking
around the neighborhood and looking at the houses and the lawns and the colorful trees and
having that be enough.
 I do not know anything about Zen or things that the Chinese or Indians do as part of their religion,
but one of the girls from the party with the tattoo and belly button ring has been a Buddhist
since July. She talks about very little else except maybe how expensive cigarettes are. I see her at
lunch sometimes, smoking between Patrick and Sam. Her name is Mary Elizabeth.
 Mary Elizabeth told me that the thing about Zen is that it makes you connected to everything in
the world. You are part of the trees and the grass and the dogs. Things like that. She even explained
how her tattoo symbolized this, but I can’t remember how. So, I guess Zen is a day like this
when you are part of the air and remember things.
 One thing I remember is that the kids used to play a game. What you would do is take a football
or something, and one person would have it, and all the other kids would try to tackle that kid.
And then whoever got the ball next would run around with it, and the kids would try to tackle him.
This could go on for hours. I never really understood the point of this game, but my brother loved
it. He didn’t like to run with the ball so much as he liked to tackle people. The kids called the
game “smear the queer.” I didn’t really think about what that means until now.
 Patrick told me the story about him and Brad, and now I understand why Patrick didn’t get angry
at Brad at the homecoming dance for dancing with a girl. When they were both juniors, Patrick
and Brad were at a party together with the rest of the popular kids. Patrick actually used to be
popular before Sam bought him some good music.
 Patrick and Brad both got pretty drunk at this party. Actually, Patrick said that Brad was pretending
to be a lot drunker than he really was. They were sitting in the basement with some girl
named Heather, and when she left to go to the bathroom, Brad and Patrick were left alone. Patrick
said it was uncomfortable and exciting for both of them.
27
 “You’re in Mr. Brosnahan’s class, right?”
 “Have you ever gone to a Pink Floyd Laser Light Show?”
 “Beer before liquor. Never sicker.”
 When they ran out of small talk, they just looked at each other. And they ended up fooling
around right there in the basement. Patrick said it was like the weight of the whole world left both
their shoulders.
 But Monday in school, Brad kept saying the same thing.
 “Man, I was so wasted. I don’t remember a thing.”
 He said it to everyone who was at the party. He said it a few times to the same people. He even
said it to Patrick. Nobody saw Patrick and Brad fool around, but Brad kept saying it anyway. That
Friday, there was another party. And this time, Patrick and Brad got stoned although Patrick said
that Brad was pretending to be a lot more stoned than he really was. And they ended up fooling
around again. And Monday in school, Brad did the same thing.
 “Man, I was so wasted. I don’t remember a thing.”
 This went on for seven months.
 It got to a point where Brad was getting stoned or drunk before school. It’s not like he and Patrick
were fooling around in school. They only fooled around at parties on Fridays, but Patrick said
Brad couldn’t even look at him in the hall, let alone speak with him. And it was hard, too, because
Patrick really liked Brad.
 When summer came, Brad didn’t have to worry about school or anything, so his drinking and
smoking got a lot worse. There was a big party at Patrick and Sam’s house with the less than popular
crowd. Brad showed up, which caused quite a stir because he was popular, but Patrick kept a
secret as to why Brad came to the party. When most people left, Brad and Patrick went into Patrick’s
room.
 They had sex for the first time that night.
 I don’t want to go into detail about it because it’s pretty private stuff, but I will say that Brad assumed
the role of the girl in terms of where you put things. I think that’s pretty important to tell
you. When they were finished, Brad started to cry really hard. He had been drinking a lot. And
getting really really stoned.
 No matter what Patrick did, Brad kept crying. Brad wouldn’t even let Patrick hold him, which
seems rather sad to me because if I have sex with someone, I would want to hold them.
 Finally, Patrick just pulled up Brad’s pants, and said to him.
 “Just pretend you’re passed out.”
 Then, Patrick got dressed and walked around the house to go into the party from a different
direction than his bedroom. He was also crying pretty bad, and he decided if anyone asked him, he
would say his eyes were red from smoking pot. Finally, he shook himself out of it and walked into
the main party room. He acted really drunk. He went to Sam. “Have you seen Brad?” Sam saw
the look in Patrick’s eyes. Then, she spoke up to the party.
28
 “Hey, has anyone seen Brad?”
 Nobody at the party had, so a few people went to search for him. They finally found him in
Patrick’s room ... asleep.
 Finally, Patrick called Brad’s parents because he was really worried about him. He didn’t tell
them why, but he said that Brad was really sick at this party and needed to be taken home. Brad’s
parents did come, and Brad’s father, along with some of the other boys including Patrick, carried
Brad to the car.
 Patrick doesn’t know if Brad was really asleep or not at that point, but if he wasn’t, it was a
good acting job. Brad’s parents sent him to rehabilitation because Brad’s father didn’t want him to
miss his chance at a football scholarship. Patrick didn’t see Brad for the rest of the summer.
 Brad’s parents never did figure out why their son was getting stoned and drunk all the time.
Neither did anybody else. Except the people who knew.
 When the school year started, Brad avoided Patrick a lot. He never went to the same parties as
Patrick or anything until a little over a month ago. That was the night he threw rocks at Patrick’s
window and told Patrick that nobody could know, and Patrick understood. They only see each
other now at night on golf courses and at parties like Bob’s where the people are quiet and understand
these things.
 I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and Patrick just said that he wasn’t
sad because at least now, Brad doesn’t have to get drunk or stoned to make love.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 November 8, 1991 Dear friend,
 Bill gave me my first B in advanced English class for my paper on Peter Pan! To tell you the
truth, I don’t know what I did differently from the other papers. He told me that my sense of
language is improving along with my sentence structure. I think it’s great that I could be improving
on these things without noticing. By the way, Bill gives me A’s on my report cards and letters to my
parents. The grades on these papers are just between us.
 I have decided that maybe I want to write when I grow up. I just don’t know what I would
write.
 I thought about maybe writing for magazines just so I could see an article that didn’t say things
like I mentioned before. “As ---- wiped the honey mustard off of her lips, she spoke to me about
her third husband and the healing power of crystals.” But honestly, I think I would be a very bad
reporter because I can’t imagine sitting across the table from a politician or a movie star and asking
them questions. I think I would probably just ask for their autograph for my mom or something. I
would probably get fired for doing this. So, I thought about maybe writing for a newspaper instead
because I could ask regular people questions, but my sister says that newspapers always lie. I do not
know if this is true, so I’ll just have to see when I get older.
29
 I did start working for a fanzine called Punk Rocky. It’s this xerox magazine about punk rock
and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I don’t write for it, but I help out.
 Mary Elizabeth is in charge of it, just like she is in charge of the local Rocky Horror Picture
Show showings. Mary Elizabeth is a very interesting person because she has a tattoo that symbolizes
Buddhism and a belly button ring and wears her hair to make somebody mad, but when she’s in
charge of something, she acts like my dad when he comes home from a “long day.” She is a senior,
and she says that my sister is a tease and a snob. I told her not to say anything like that about my
sister again.
 Of all the things I’ve done this year so far, I think I like The Rocky Horror Picture Show the
best. Patrick and Sam took me to the theater to see it on Halloween night. It’s really fun because
all these kids dress up like the people in the movie, and they act out the movie in front of the
screen. Also, people shout at the movie on cue. I guess you probably know this already, but I
thought I’d say it anyway in case you didn’t.
 Patrick plays “Frank ‘Not Furter.” Sam plays “Janet.” It is very hard to watch the movie because
Sam walks around in her underwear when she plays Janet. I am really trying not to think of her
that way, which is becoming increasingly difficult.
 To tell you the truth, I love Sam. It’s not a movie kind of love either. I just look at her sometimes,
and I think she is the prettiest and nicest person in the whole world. She is also very smart
and fun. I wrote her a poem after I saw her in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but I didn’t show
it to her because I was embarrassed. I would write it out for you, but I think that would be disrespectful
to Sam.
 The thing is that Sam is now going out with a boy named Craig.
 Craig is older than my brother. I think he may even be twenty-one because he drinks red wine.
Craig plays “Rocky” in the show. Patrick says that Craig is “cut and hunky.” I do not know where
Patrick finds his expressions.
 But I guess that he’s right, Craig is cut and hunky. He is also a very creative person. He’s putting
himself through the Art Institute here by being a male model for JCPenney catalogs and things
like that. He likes to take photographs, and I’ve seen a few of them, and they are very good. There
is this one photograph of Sam that is just beautiful. It would be impossible to describe how beautiful
it is, but I’ll try.
 If you listen to the song “Asleep,” and you think about those pretty weather days that make you
remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you’ve known, and you cry, and the person
holds you back, then I think you will see the photograph.
 I want Sam to stop liking Craig.
 Now, I guess maybe you think that’s because I am jealous of him. I’m not. Honest. It’s just
that Craig doesn’t really listen to her when she talks. I don’t mean that he’s a bad guy because he’s
not. It’s just that he always looks distracted.
 It’s like he would take a photograph of Sam, and the photograph would be beautiful. And he
would think that the reason the photograph was beautiful was because of how he took it. If I took
it, I would know that the only reason it’s beautiful is because of Sam.
30
 I just think it’s bad when a boy looks at a girl and thinks that the way he sees the girl is better
than the girl actually is. And I think it’s bad when the most honest way a boy can look at a girl is
through a camera. It’s very hard for me to see Sam feel better about herself just because an older
boy sees her that way.
 I asked my sister about this, and she said that Sam has low self-esteem. My sister also said that
Sam had a reputation when she was a sophomore. According to my sister, Sam used to be a “blow
queen.” I hope you know what that means because I really can’t think about Sam and describe it to
you.
 I am really in love with Sam, and it hurts very much.
 I did ask my sister about the boy at the dance. She wouldn’t talk about it until I promised that
I wouldn’t tell anybody, not even Bill. So, I promised. She said that she has been seeing this boy
secretly since Dad said she couldn’t. She says she thinks about him when he’s not there. She says
they’re going to get married after they both finish college, and he finishes law school.
 She told me not to worry because he hasn’t hit her since that night. And she said not to worry
because he won’t hit her again. She really didn’t say any more other than that, although she kept
talking.
 It was nice sitting with my sister that night because she almost never likes to talk to me. I was
surprised that she told me as much as she did, but I guess that since she’s keeping things secret, she
can’t tell anybody. And I guess she was just dying to tell somebody.
 But as much as she told me not to, I do worry a lot about her. She is my sister, after all.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 November 12, 1991 Dear friend,
 I love Twinkies, and the reason I am saying that is because we are all supposed to think of
reasons to live. In science class, Mr. As. told us about an experiment where they got this rat or
mouse, and they put this rat or mouse on one side of a cage. On the other side of the cage, they
put a little piece of food. And this rat or mouse would walk over to the food and eat. Then, they
put the rat or mouse back on xsdc original side, and this time, they put electricity all through the
floor where the rat or mouse would have to walk to get the piece of food. They did this for a
while, and the rat or mouse stopped going to get the food at a certain amount of voltage. Then,
they repeated the experiment, but they replaced the food with something that gave the rat or mouse
intense pleasure. I don’t know what it was that gave them intense pleasure, but I am guessing it is
some kind of rat or mouse nip. Anyway, what the scientists found out was that the rat or mouse
would put up with a lot more voltage for the pleasure. Even more than for the food.
 I don’t know the significance of this, but I find it very interesting.
 Love always,
31
 Charlie
 November 15, 1991 Dear friend,
 It’s starting to get cold and frosty here. The pretty fall weather is pretty much gone. The good
news is that we have holidays coming up, which I love especially now because my brother will be
coming home soon. Maybe even for Thanksgiving! At least I hope he does for my mom.
 My brother hasn’t called home in a few weeks now, and Mom just keeps talking about his grades
and sleeping habits and the foods he eats, and my dad keeps saying the same thing.
 “He’s not going to get injured.”
 Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies.
I don’t mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like the movie where the guy meets a
smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss
in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally
beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think. I personally find “super models”
strange. I don’t know why this is.
 My brother, on the other hand, has posters of “super models” and cars and beer and things like
that on the walls in his room. I suppose if you add a dirty floor, it’s probably what his dorm room
looks like. My brother always hated making his bed, but he kept his clothes closet very organized.
Go figure.
 The thing is, when my brother does call home, he doesn’t say a lot. He talks about his classes a
little bit, but mostly he talks about the football team. There is a lot of attention on the team because
they are very good, and they have some really big players. My brother said that one of the
guys will probably be a millionaire someday, but that he is “dumb as a post.” I guess that’s pretty
dumb.
 My brother told this one story where the whole team was sitting around the locker room, talking
about all the stuff they had to do to get into college football. They finally got around to talking
about SAT scores, which I have never taken.
 And this guy said, “I got a 710.”
 And my brother said, “Math or verbal?”
 And the guy said, “Huh?”
 And the whole team laughed.
 I always wanted to be on a sports team like that. I’m not exactly sure why, but I always thought
it would be fun to have “glory days.” Then, I would have stories to tell my children and golf buddies.
I guess I could tell people about Punk Rocky and walking home from school and things like
that. Maybe these are my glory days, and I’m not even realizing it because they don’t involve a ball.
 I used to play sports when I was little, and I was actually very good, but the problem was that it
used to make me too aggressive, so the doctors told my mom I would have to stop.
32
 My dad had glory days once. I’ve seen pictures of him when he was young. He was a very
handsome man. I don’t know any other way to put it. He looked like all old pictures look. Old
pictures look very rugged and young, and the people in the photographs always seem a lot happier
than you are.
 My mother looks beautiful in old pictures. She actually looks more beautiful than anyone except
maybe Sam. Sometimes, I look at my parents now and wonder what happened to make them the
way they are. And then I wonder what will happen to my sister when her boyfriend graduates from
law school. And what my brother’s face will look like on a football card, or what it will look like
if it is never on a football card. My dad played college baseball for two years, but he had to stop
when Mom got pregnant with my brother. That’s when he started working at the office. I honestly
don’t know what my dad does.
 He tells a story sometimes. It is a great story. It has to do with the state championship for
baseball when he was in high school. It was the bottom of the ninth inning, and there was a runner
on first. There were two outs, and my dad’s team was behind by one run. My dad was younger
than most of the varsity team because he was only a sophomore, and I think the team thought he
was going to blow the game. He had all this pressure on him. He was really nervous. And really
scared. But after a few pitches, he said he started feeling “in the zone.” When the pitcher wound
up and threw the next ball, he knew exactly where that ball was going to be. He hit it harder than
any other ball he ever hit in his whole life. And he made a home run, and his team won the state
championship. The greatest thing about this story is that every time my dad tells it, it never changes.
He’s not one to exaggerate.
 I think about all this sometimes when I’m watching a football game with Patrick and Sam. I
look at the field, and I think about the boy who just made the touchdown. I think that these are
the glory days for that boy, and this moment will just be another story someday because all the
people who make touchdowns and home runs will become somebody’s dad. And when his children
look at his yearbook photograph, they will think that their dad was rugged and handsome and
looked a lot happier than they are.
 I just hope I remember to tell my kids that they are as happy as I look in my old photographs.
And I hope that they believe me.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 November 18, 1991 Dear friend,
 My brother finally called yesterday, and he can’t make it home for any part of Thanksgiving
weekend because he is behind on school because of football. My mom was so upset that she took
me shopping for new clothes.
 I know you think what I’m about to write is an exaggeration, but I promise you that it isn’t.
From the time we got into the car to the time we came home, my mom literally did not stop talking.
Not once. Not even when I was in the dressing room trying on “slacks.”
33
 She just stood outside the dressing room and worried out loud. The things she said went all
over the place. First, it was that my dad should’ve insisted that my brother come home if only for
an afternoon. Then, it was that my sister had better start thinking more about her future and start
applying to “safety” schools in case the good ones don’t work out. And then she started saying that
gray was a good color for me.
 I understand how my mom thinks. I really do.
 It’s like when we were little, and we would go to the grocery store. My sister and brother would
fight about things that my sister and brother would fight about, and I would sit at the bottom of
the shopping cart. And my mom would be so upset by the end of shopping that she would push
the cart fast, and I would feel like I was in a submarine.
 Yesterday was like that except now I got to sit in the front seat.
 When I saw Sam and Patrick at school today, they both agreed that my mom has very good taste
in clothing. I told my mom this when I got home from school, and she smiled. She asked me if I
wanted to invite Sam and Patrick over for dinner sometime after the holidays are over because my
mom gets nervous enough as it is during the holidays. I called Sam and Patrick, and they said they
would.
 I’m really excited!
 The last time I had a friend over to dinner was Michael last year. We had tacos. The really
great part was that Michael stayed over to sleep. We ended up sleeping very little. We mostly just
talked about things like girls and movies and music. The one part I remember distinctly was walking
around the neighborhood at night. My parents were asleep along with the rest of the houses.
Michael looked into all the windows. It was dark and quiet.
 He said, “Do you think those people are nice?”
 I said, “The Andersons? Yeah. They’re old.”
 “What about those people?”
 “Well, Mrs. Lambert doesn’t like baseballs going into her yard.”
 “What about those people?”
 “Mrs. Tanner has been visiting her mother for three months. Mr. Tanner spends his weekends
sitting on the back porch and listening to baseball games. I don’t really know if they’re nice or not
because they don’t have children.”
 “Is she sick?”
 “Is who sick?”
 “Mrs. Tanner’s mother.”
 “I don’t think so. My mom would know, and she didn’t say anything.”
 Michael nodded. “They’re getting a divorce.”
 “You think so?”
 “Uh-huh.”
34
 We just kept walking. Michael had a way of walking quiet sometimes. I guess I should mention
that my mom heard that Michael’s parents are divorced now. She said that only seventy percent of
marriages stay together when they lose a child. I think she read it in a magazine somewhere.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 November 23, 1991 Dear friend,
 Do you enjoy holidays with your family? I don’t mean your mom and dad family, but your uncle
and aunt and cousin family? Personally, I do. There are several reasons for this.
 First, I am very interested and fascinated by how everyone loves each other, but no one really
likes each other. Second, the fights are always the same.
 They usually start when my mom’s dad (my grandfather) finishes his third drink. It is around
this time that he starts to talk a lot. My grandfather usually just complains about black people
moving into the old neighborhood, and then my sister gets upset at him, and then my grandfather
tells her that she doesn’t know what she’s talking about because she lives in the suburbs. And then
he says how no one visits him in his retirement home. And finally he starts talking about all of the
family’s secrets, like how cousin so-and-so “knocked up” that waitress from the Big Boy. I should
probably mention that my grandfather can’t hear very well, so he says all of these things really loud.
 My sister tries to fight him, but she never wins. My grandfather is definitely more stubborn than
she is. My mom usually helps her aunt prepare the food, which my grandfather always says is “too
dry” even if it’s soup. And her aunt will then cry and lock herself in the bathroom.
 There is only one bathroom in my great aunt’s house, so this turns to trouble when all the beer
starts to hit my cousins. They stand twisted in bladder positions and bang on the door for a few
minutes and almost coax my great aunt out, but then my grandfather curses something at my great
aunt, and the cycle starts over again. With the exception of the one holiday when my grandfather
passed out just after dinner, my cousins always have to go to the bathroom outside in the bushes.
If you look out the windows like I do, you can see them, and it looks like they’re on one of their
hunting trips. I feel terribly sorry for my girl cousins and my other great aunts because they don’t
really have the bushes option, especially when it’s cold.
 I should mention that my dad usually just sits real quiet and drinks. My dad is not a big drinker
at all, but when he has to spend time with my mom’s family, he gets “loaded,” as my cousin Tommy
says. Deep down, I think my dad would rather spend the holiday with his family in Ohio. That
way, he wouldn’t have to be around my grandfather. He doesn’t like my grandfather very much, but
he keeps quiet about it. Even on the ride home. He just doesn’t think it’s his place.
 As the evening comes to an end, my grandfather is usually too drunk to do much of anything.
My dad and my brother and my cousins carry him out to the car of the person who is least angry at
him. It has always been my job to open doors for them along the way. My grandfather is very fat.
 I remember there was one time that my brother drove my grandfather back to the retirement
35
home, and I rode along. My brother always understood my grandfather. He rarely got angry at him
unless my grandfather said something mean about my mom or sister or made a scene in public. I
remember it was snowing really hard, and it was very quiet. Almost peaceful. And my grandfather
calmed down and started talking a different kind of talk.
 He told us that when he was sixteen, he had to leave school because his dad died, and someone
had to support the family. He talked about the time when he had to go to the mill three times a day
to see if there was any work for him. And he talked about how cold it was. And how hungry he
was because he made sure his family always ate before him. Things he said we just wouldn’t understand
because we were lucky. Then, he talked about his daughters, my mom and Aunt Helen.
 “I know how your mom feels about me. I know Helen, too. There was one time ... I went to
the mill ... no work ... none. ... I came home at two in the morning ... pissed and pissed ... your
grandmother showed me their report cards ... C-plus average ... and these were smart girls. So, I
went into their room and I beat some sense into them ... and when it was done and they were crying,
I just held up their report cards and said ... `This will never happen again.’ She still talks about
it ... your mother ... but you know something ... it never did happen again ... they went to college
... both of them. I just wish I could have sent them ... I always wanted to send them. ... I wish
Helen could have understood that. I think your mother did ... deep down ... she’s a good woman
... you should be proud of her.”
 When I told my mom about this, she just looked very sad because he could never say those
things to her. Not ever. Not even when he walked her down the aisle.
 But this Thanksgiving was different. It was my brother’s football game, which we brought a
VCR tape of for my relatives to watch. The whole family was gathered around the TV, even my
great aunts, who never watch football. I’ll never forget the looks on their faces when my brother
took the field. It was a mixture of all things. My one cousin works in a gas station. And my other
cousin has been out of work for two years since he injured his hand. And my other cousin has
been wanting to go back to college for around seven years. And my dad said once that they were
very jealous of my brother because he had a shot in life and was actually doing something about it.
 But in that moment when my brother took the field, all that washed away, and everyone was
proud. At one point, my brother made a very big play on third down, and everyone cheered even
though some of us had already seen the game before. I looked up at my dad, and he was smiling.
I looked at my mom, and she was smiling even though she was nervous about my brother getting
hurt, which was strange because it was a VCR tape of an old game, and she knew he didn’t get
hurt. My great aunts and my cousins and their children and everyone were also smiling. Even my
sister. There were only two people who weren’t smiling. My grandfather and I.
 My grandfather was crying.
 The kind of crying that is quiet and a secret. The kind of crying that only I noticed. I thought
about him going into my mom’s room when she was little and hitting my mom and holding up her
report card and saying that her bad grades would never happen again. And I think now that maybe
he meant my older brother. Or my sister. Or me. That he would make sure that he was the last
one to work in a mill.
36
 I don’t know if that’s good or bad. I don’t know if it’s better to have your kids be happy and
not go to college. I don’t know if it’s better to be close with your daughter or make sure that she
has a better life than you do. I just don’t know. I was just quiet, and I watched him.
 When the game was over and dinner was finished, everyone said what they were thankful for.
A lot of it had to do with my brother or family or children or God. And everyone meant it when
they said it regardless of what would happen tomorrow. When it came to my turn I thought about
it a lot because this was my first time sitting at the big table with all the grown-ups since my brother
wasn’t here to take his seat.
 “I’m thankful that my brother played football on television so nobody fought.”
 Most of the people around the table looked uncomfortable. Some looked angry. My dad
looked like he knew I was right, but he didn’t want to say anything because it wasn’t his family. My
mom was nervous about what her dad would do. Only one person at the table said anything. It
was my great aunt, the one who usually locks herself in the bathroom.
 “Amen.”
 And somehow that made it all right.
 When we were all getting ready to leave, I walked up to my grandfather and gave him a hug and
a kiss on the cheek. He wiped my lip print off with his palm and gave me a look. He doesn’t like
the boys in the family to touch him. But I’m very glad that I did it anyway in case he dies. I never
got to do that with my Aunt Helen.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 7, 1991 Dear friend,
 Have you ever heard of a thing called “Secret Santa?” It’s this activity where a group of friends
draw names out of a hat, and they are supposed to buy a lot of Christmas presents for whatever
person they choose. The presents are “secretly” placed in their lockers when they’re not there.
Then, at the end, you have a party, and all the people reveal who they really are as they give their
last presents.
 Sam started doing this with her group of friends three years ago. Now, it’s some tradition. And
supposedly the party at the end is always the best of the year. It happens the night after our last
day of school before the break.
 I don’t know who got me. I got Patrick.
 I’m really glad I got Patrick even though I wished for Sam. I haven’t seen Patrick in a few weeks
except in shop class because he has been spending most of his time with Brad, so thinking about
presents is a good way to think about him.
 The first present is going to be a mix tape. I just know that it should. I already have the songs
picked and a theme. It’s called “One Winter.” But I’ve decided not to hand-color the cover. The
37
first side has a lot of songs by the Village People and Blondie because Patrick likes that type of
music a lot. It also has Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana, which Sam and Patrick love. But the
second side is the one I like the most. It has winter kind of songs.
 Here they are:
 Asleep by the Smiths Vapour Trail by Ride Scarborough Fair by Simon and Garfunkel A Whiter
Shade of Pale by Procol
 Harum Time of No Reply by Nick Drake Dear Prudence by the Beatles Gypsy by Suzanne
Vega Nights in White Satin by the Moody
 Blues Daydream by Smashing Pumpkins Dusk by Genesis (before Phil Collins was
 even in the band!) MLK by Ubleb Blackbird by the Beatles Landslide by Fleetwood Mac
 And finally ...
 Asleep by the Smiths (again!)
 I spent all night working on it, and I hope Patrick likes it as much as I do. Especially the second
side. I hope it’s the kind of second side that he can listen to whenever he drives alone and feel like
he belongs to something whenever he’s sad. I hope it can be that for him.
 I had an amazing feeling when I finally held the tape in my hand. I just thought to myself that
in the palm of my hand, there was this one tape that had all of these memories and feelings and
great joy and sadness. Right there in the palm of my hand. And I thought about how many people
have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those
songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs
really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of
them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote thosef songs are happy. I hope that
they feel it’s enough. I really do because they’ve made me happy. And I’m only one person.
 I can’t wait to get my driver’s license. It’s coming up soon!
 Incidentally, I have not told you about Bill in a while. But I guess there’s not a lot to tell because
he just keeps giving me books that he doesn’t give his other students, and I keep reading them,
and he keeps asking me to write papers, and I do. In the last month or so, I have read The Great
Gatsby and A Separate Peace. I am starting to see a real trend in the kind of books Bill gives me to
read. And just like the tape of songs, it is amazing to hold each of them in the palm of my hand.
They are all my favorites. All of them.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 11, 1991 Dear friend,
 Patrick loved the tape! I think he knows that I’m his Secret Santa, though, because I think he
knows that only I would do a tape like that. He also knows what my handwriting looks like. I don’t
know why I don’t think of these things until it’s too late. I really should have saved it for my last

present.
 Incidentally, I have thought of my second gift for Patrick. It is magnetic poetry. Have you
heard of this? In case you haven’t, I will explain. Some guy or girl put a whole bunch of words on
a sheet of magnet and then cut the words into separate pieces. You put them on your refrigerator,
and then you write poems while you make a sandwich. It’s very fun.
 The gift from my Secret Santa wasn’t anything special. That makes me sad. I bet you anything
that Mary Elizabeth is my Secret Santa because only she would give me socks.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 19, 1991 Dear friend,
 I have since received thrift store “slacks.” I have also received a tie, a white shirt, shoes, and an
old belt. I’m guessing that my last gift at the party will be a suit coat because it’s the only thing left.
I was told by a typed note to wear everything I had been given to the party. I hope there is something
behind this.
 The good news is that Patrick liked all my gifts very much. Gift number three was a set of
watercolor paints and some paper. I thought he might like to get them even if he never uses them.
Gift number four was a harmonica and a book about playing it. I guess it’s probably the same gift
as the water colors, but I really think that everyone should have watercolors, magnetic poetry, and a
harmonica.
 My last gift before the party is a book called The Mayor of Castro Street. It is about a man
named Harvey Milk, who was a gay leader in San Francisco. I went to the library when Patrick told
me he was gay, and I did some research because I honestly didn’t know much about it. I found an
article about a documentary movie about Harvey Milk. And when I couldn’t find the movie, I just
searched for his name, and I found this book.
 I have not read it myself, but the description on the book seemed very good. I hope that it
means something to Patrick. I can’t wait for the party, so I can give Patrick my party present. Incidentally,
I have taken all my finals for the semester, and it has been very busy, and I would have
told you all about it, but it just doesn’t seem as interesting as these other things that have to do with
holidays.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 21, 1991 Dear friend,
 Wow. Wow. I can paint the picture for you if you like. We are all sitting in Sam and Patrick’s
house, which I had never seen before. It was a rich house. Very clean. And we were all giving our
39
final presents. The outside lights were on, and it was snowing, and it looked like magic. Like we
were somewhere else. Like we were someplace better.
 It was the first time I had ever met Sam and Patrick’s parents. They were so nice. Sam’s mom
is very pretty and tells great jokes. Sam said she used to be an actress when she was younger. Patrick’s
dad is very tall and has a great handshake. He is also a very good cook. A lot of parents
make you feel very awkward when you meet them. But not Sam and Patrick’s. They were friendly
all through dinner, and when dinner was over, they left so we could have our party. They didn’t
even check on us or anything. Not once. They just let us pretend it was our house. So, we decided
to have the party in the “games” room, which had no games but a great rug.
 When I revealed that I was Patrick’s Secret Santa, everyone laughed because everyone knew,
and Patrick did his best impersonation of being surprised, which was nice of him. Then, everyone
asked what my last gift was, and I told them it was a poem I read a long time ago. It was a poem
that Michael made a copy of for me. And I have read it a thousand times since because I don’t
know who wrote it. I don’t know if it was ever in a book or a class. And I don’t know how old the
person was. But I know that I want to know him or her. I want to know that this person is okay.
 So, everyone asked me to stand up and read the poem. And I wasn’t shy because we were trying
to act like grown-ups, and we drank brandy. And I was warm. I’m still a little warm, but I have to
tell you this. So, I stood up, and just before I read this poem, I asked everyone if they knew who
wrote it to please tell me.
 When I was done reading the poem, everyone was quiet. A very sad quiet. But the amazing
thing was that it wasn’t a bad sad at all. It was just something that made everyone look around at
each other and know that they were there. Sam and Patrick looked at me. And I looked at them.
And I think they knew. Not anything specific really. They just knew. And I think that’s all you can
ever ask from a friend.
 That’s when Patrick put on the second side of the tape I made for him and poured everyone
another glass of brandy. I guess we all looked a little silly drinking it, but we didn’t feel silly. I can
tell you that.
 As the songs kept playing, Mary Elizabeth stood up. But she wasn’t holding a suit coat. It turns
out that she wasn’t my Secret Santa at all. She was the Secret Santa to the other girl with the tattoo
and belly button ring, whose real name is Alice. She gave her some black nail polish that Alice had
had her eye on. And Alice was very grateful. I just sat there, looking around the room. Looking
for the suit coat. Not knowing who could possibly be holding it.
 Sam stood up next, and she gave Bob a handcrafted Native American marijuana pipe, which
seemed appropriate.
 More people gave more gifts. And more hugs were exchanged. And finally, it came to the end.
No one was left except for Patrick. And he stood up and walked into the kitchen.
 “Does anyone want any chips?”
 Everyone did. And he came out with three tubes of Pringles and a suit coat. And he walked up
to me. And he said that all the great writers used to wear suits all the time.
 So, I put on the suit even though I didn’t feel like I really deserved to since all I write are essays
40
for Bill, but it was such a nice present, and everyone clapped their hands anyway. Sam and Patrick
both agreed I looked handsome. Mary Elizabeth smiled. I think it was the first time in my life I
ever felt like I looked “good.” Do you know what I mean? That nice feeling when you look in the
mirror, and your hair’s right for the first time in your life? I don’t think we should base so much on
weight, muscles, and a good hair day, but when it happens, it’s nice. It really is.
 The rest of the evening was very special. Since a lot of people were going away with their families
to places like Florida and Indiana, we all exchanged presents with the people we weren’t Secret
Santas for.
 Bob gave Patrick an eighth of marijuana with a Christmas card attached. He even wrapped it.
Mary Elizabeth gave Sam earrings. So did Alice. And Sam gave them earrings, too. I think that is
a private girl thing. I have to admit, I felt a little sad because other than Sam and Patrick, nobody
got me a present. I guess I’m not that close with them, so it makes sense. But I still felt a little sad.
 And then it came to my turn. I gave Bob a little plastic tube of soap bubbles because it just
seemed to fit his personality. I guess I was right.
 “Too much,” was all he said.
 He spent the rest of the night blowing bubbles at the ceiling.
 Next was Alice. I gave her a book by Anne Rice because she is always talking about her. And
she looked at me like she couldn’t believe I knew she loved Anne Rice. I guess she didn’t know
how much she talked or how much I listen. But she thanked me all the same. Next came Mary
Elizabeth. I gave her forty dollars inside a card. The card said something pretty simple: “To be
spent on printing Punk Rocky in color next time.”
 And she looked at me funny. Then, they all started to look at me funny except for Sam and
Patrick. I think they started feeling bad because they didn’t get me anything. But I don’t think
they should have because I don’t think that’s the point really. Mary Elizabeth just smiled, and said
thanks, and then stopped looking at me in the eye.
 Last came Sam. I had been thinking about this present for a long time. I think I thought about
this present from the first time I really saw her. Not met her or saw her but the first time I really
saw her if you know what I mean. There was a card attached.
 Inside the card, I told Sam that the present I gave her was given to me by my Aunt Helen. It
was an old 45 record that had the Beatles’ song “Something.” I used to listen to it all the time when
I was little and thinking about grown-up things. I would go to my bedroom window and stare at
my reflection in the glass and the trees behind it and just listen to the song for hours. I decided
then that when I met someone I thought was as beautiful as the song, I should give it to that person.
And I didn’t mean beautiful on the outside. I meant beautiful in all ways. So, I was giving it to
Sam.
 Sam looked at me soft. And she hugged me. And I closed my eyes because I wanted to know
nothing but her arms. And she kissed my cheek and whispered so nobody could hear.
 “I love you.”
 I knew that she meant it in a friend way, but I didn’t care because it was the third time since my
41
Aunt Helen died that I heard it from anyone. The other two times were from my mom.
 After that, I couldn’t believe that Sam actually got me a present because I honestly thought that
the “I love you” was it. But she did get me a present. And for the first time, something nice like
that made me smile and not cry. I guess Sam and Patrick went to the same thrift store because their
gifts went together. She took me to her room and stood me in front of her dresser, which was
covered in a pillowcase with pretty colors. She lifted off the pillowcase, and there I was, standing in
my old suit, looking at an old typewriter with a fresh ribbon. Inside the typewriter was a piece of
white paper.
 On that piece of white paper, Sam wrote, “Write about me sometime.” And I typed something
back to her, standing right there in her bedroom. I just typed.
 “I will.”
 And I felt good that those were the first two words that I ever typed on my new old typewriter
that Sam gave me. We just sat there quiet for a moment, and she smiled. And I moved to the typewriter
again, and I wrote something.
 “I love you, too.”
 And Sam looked at the paper, and she looked at me.
 “Charlie ... have you ever kissed a girl?”
 I shook my head no. It was so quiet.
 “Not even when you were little?”
 I shook my head no again. And she looked very sad.
 She told me about the first time she was kissed. She told me that it was with one of her dad’s
friends. She was seven. And she told nobody about it except for Mary Elizabeth and then Patrick
a year ago. And she started to cry. And she said something that I won’t forget. Ever.
 “I know that you know that I like Craig. And I know that I told you not to think of me that
way. And I know that we can’t be together like that. But I want to forget all those things for a minute.
Okay?”
 “Okay.”
 “I want to make sure that the first person you kiss loves you. Okay?”
 “Okay.” She was crying harder now. And I was, too, because when I hear something like that I
just can’t help it.
 “I just want to make sure of that. Okay?”
 “Okay.”
 And she kissed me. It was the kind of kiss that I could never tell my friends about out loud. It
was the kind of kiss that made me know that I was never so happy in my whole life.
 Once on a yellow piece of paper with green
 lines he wrote a poem And he called it “Chops” because that was the name of his dog And
that’s what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and a gold star And his mother hung it
42
on the kitchen door and read it to his aunts
 That was the year Father Tracy took all the kids to the zoo And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born with tiny toenails and no hair And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a Valentine signed with a row of X’s and he had to ask his
father what the X’s meant And his father always tucked him in bed at night And was always there to
do it Once on a piece of white paper with blue
 lines he wrote a poem And he called it “Autumn” because that was the name of the season And
that’s what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and asked him to write more clearly And
his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because of its new paint And the kids told him that
Father Tracy smoked cigars And left butts on the pews And sometimes they would burn holes That
was the year his sister got glasses with thick lenses and black frames And the girl around the corner
laughed when he asked her to go see Santa Claus And the kids told him why his mother and father
kissed a lot And his father never tucked him in bed at night And his father got mad when he cried
for him to do it.
 Once on a paper torn from his notebook he wrote a poem And he called it “Innocence: A
Question” because that was the question about his girl And that’s what it was all about And his
professor gave him an A and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen
door because he never showed her That was the year that Father Tracy died And he forgot how the
end of the Apostle’s Creed went And he caught his sister making out on the back porch And his
mother and father never kissed or even talked And the girl around the corner wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her but he kissed her anyway because that was the thing
to do And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed his father snoring soundly That’s why on the
back of a brown paper bag he tried another poem And he called it “Absolutely Nothing” Because
that’s what it was really all about And he gave himself an A and a slash on each damned wrist And
he hung it on the bathroom door because this time he didn’t think he could reach the kitchen.
 That was the poem I read for Patrick. Nobody knew who wrote it, but Bob said he heard it
before, and he heard that it was some kid’s suicide note. I really hope it wasn’t because then I don’t
know if I like the ending.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 23, 1991 Dear friend,
 Sam and Patrick left with their family for the Grand Canyon yesterday. I don’t feel too bad
about it because I can still remember Sam’s kiss. It feels peaceful and right. I even considered not
washing my lips like they do on TV, but then I thought it would get too gross. So, instead I spent
today walking around the neighborhood. I even got out my old sled and my old scarf. There is
something cozy about that for me.
 I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I
watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are
43
going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And
they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if
sledding were always enough, but it isn’t.
 I’m really glad that Christmas and my birthday are soon because that means they will be over
soon because I can already feel myself going to a bad place I used to go. After my Aunt Helen was
gone, I went to that place. It got so bad that my mom had to take me to a doctor, and I was held
back a grade. But now I’m trying not to think about it too much because that makes it worse.
 It’s kind of like when you look at yourself in the mirror and you say your name. And it gets to a
point where none of it seems real. Well, sometimes, I can do that, but I don’t need an hour in front
of a mirror. It happens very fast, and things start to slip away. And I just open my eyes, and I see
nothing. And then I start to breathe really hard trying to see something, but I can’t. It doesn’t happen
all the time, but when it does, it scares me.
 It almost happened this morning, but I thought of Sam’s kiss, and it went away.
 I probably shouldn’t be writing about this too much because it brings it up too much. It makes
me think too much. And I am trying to participate. It’s just hard because Sam and Patrick are in
the Grand Canyon.
 Tomorrow, I’m going with my mom to buy presents for everyone. And then we are celebrating
my birthday. I was born on December 24. I don’t know if I ever told you that. It’s a strange birthday
to have because it is so close to Christmas. After that, we are celebrating Christmas with my
dad’s family, and my brother will be home for a little while. Then, I’m going out to take my driver’s
test, so I will be busy while Sam and Patrick are gone.
 Tonight, I watched some television with my sister, but she didn’t want to watch the Christmas
specials that were on, so I decided to go upstairs and read.
 Bill gave me one book to read over the break. It’s The Catcher in the Rye. It was Bill’s favorite
book when he was my age. He said it was the kind of book you made your own.
 I read the first twenty pages. I don’t know how I feel about it just yet, but it does seem appropriate
to this time. I hope Sam and Patrick call on my birthday. It would make me feel much better.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 25, 1991 Dear friend,
 I am sitting in my dad’s old bedroom in Ohio. The family is still downstairs. I really don’t feel
very well. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m starting to get scared. I wish we were going
back home tonight, but we always sleep over. I don’t want to tell my mom about it because it
would just make her worry.dc I would tell Sam and Patrick, but they didn’t call yesterday. And we
left this morning after we opened presents. Maybe they called this afternoon. I hope they didn’t
call this afternoon because I wasn’t there. I hope it’s okay that I’m telling you this. I just don’t
44
know what else to do. I always get sad when this happens, and I wish Michael were here. And I
wish my Aunt Helen were here. I miss my Aunt Helen like this. Reading the book isn’t helping
either. I don’t know. I’m just thinking too fast. Much too fast. It’s like tonight.
 The family watched It’s a Wonderful Life, which is a very beautiful movie. And all I could think
was why didn’t they make the movie about Uncle Billy? George Bailey was an important man in the
town. Because of him, a whole bunch of people got to get out of the slums. He saved a town,
and when his dad died, he was the only guy who could do it. He wanted to live an adventure, but
he stayed behind and sacrificed his dreams for the better good of the community. And then when
that made him sad, he was going to kill himself. He was going to die because his life insurance
money would have taken care of his family. And then an angel comes down and shows him what
life would be if he had never been born. How the whole town would have suffered. And how his
wife would have been an “old maid.” And my sister didn’t even say anything about how that’s such
an old-fashioned thing, this year. Every other year she says something about how Mary was working
for a living, and just because she’s not married, it doesn’t mean that she is worthless. But this
year she didn’t. I didn’t know why. I thought it might be about that secret boy of hers. Or maybe
it’s what happened in the car on the way over to our grandma’s house. I just wanted the movie
to be about Uncle Billy because he drank a lot and was fat and lost the money in the first place. I
wanted the angel to come down and show us how Uncle Billy’s life had meaning. Then, I think I’d
feel better.
 It started yesterday at home. I don’t like my birthday. I don’t like it at all. I went shopping with
my mom and sister, and my mom was in a bad mood because of parking spaces and lines. And my
sister was in a bad mood because she couldn’t buy her secret boy a present and hide it from Mom.
She would have to come back herself later. And I felt weird. Really weird, because as I was walking
around all the stores, I didn’t know what present my dad would like to receive from me. I knew
what to buy or give Sam and Patrick, but I didn’t know what I could buy or give or make for my
own dad. My brother likes posters of girls and beer cans. My sister likes a haircut gift certificate.
My mom likes old movies and plants. My dad only likes golf, and that is not a winter sport except
for in Florida, and we don’t live there. And he doesn’t play baseball anymore. He doesn’t like to be
even reminded unless he tells the stories. I just wanted to know what to buy my dad because I love
him. And I don’t know him. And he doesn’t like to talk about things like that.
 “Well, why don’t you chip in with your sister and buy him that sweater?”
 “I don’t want to. I want to buy him something. What kind of music does he like?”
 My dad doesn’t listen to music a lot anymore, and the stuff he likes, he has.
 “What kind of books does he like to read?”
 My dad doesn’t read books too much anymore because he listens to books on cassette tapes on
the way to work, and he gets them free from the library.
 What kind of movies? What kind of anything?
 My sister decided to buy the sweater on her own. And she started to get mad at me because she
needed time to come back to the store to buy that present for her secret boyfriend.
 “Just buy him some golf balls, Charlie. Jesus.”
45
 “But that’s a summer sport.”
 “Mom. Would you make him buy something?”
 “Charlie. Calm down. It’s okay.”
 I felt so sad. I didn’t know what was going on. Mom was trying to be really nice because when
I get like this, she is the one that tries real hard to keep things calm.
 “I’m sorry, Mom.”
 “No. Don’t be sorry. You want to get a nice present for your father. That’s a good thing.”
 “Mom!” My sister was really getting mad.
 My mom didn’t even look at my sister.
 “Charlie, you can buy your father whatever you want. I know he’ll love it. Now, calm down.
It’s okay.”
 My mom took me to four different stores. Each one my sister just sat in the nearest chair and
groaned. I finally found the perfect store. It was a movie place. And I found a videocassette of
the last episode of More”inA”inSo”inHave without the commercials. And I felt a lot better. Then,
I started telling Mom about how we all watched it together.
 “She knows, Charlie. She was there. Let’s go. Duh.”
 My mom told my sister to mind her own business, and she listened to me tell the story that she
already knew, leaving out the part about my dad crying because that was our little secret. My mom
even told me how I tell stories very well. I love my mom. And this time, I told her I loved her.
And she told me she loved me, too. And things were okay for a little while.
 We were sitting at the dinner table, waiting for my dad to come home with my brother from the
airport. He was really late, and my mom started to worry because it was snowing really hard outside.
And she kept my sister at home because she needed help with dinner. She wanted it to be
extra special for my brother and for me because he was coming home, and it was my birthday. But
my sister just wanted to buy her boyfriend a present. She was in a really bad mood. She was being
like those bratty girls in movies from the 1980’s, and my mom kept saying “Young lady” after every
sentence.
 My dad finally called and said that because of the snow, my brother’s plane was going to be very
late. I just heard my mom’s side of the discussion.
 “But it’s Charlie’s birthday dinner ... I don’t expect you to do anything about it ... did he miss it?
I’m just asking ... I didn’t say it was your fault ... no ... I can’t keep it warm ... it’ll be dry ... what
... but it’s his favorite ... well, what am I supposed to feed them ... of course they’re hungry ...
you’re already an hour late ... well, you could have called ...”
 I don’t know how long my mom was on the phone because I couldn’t stay at the table and listen.
I went into my room and read. I wasn’t hungry anymore anyway. I just wanted to be in a quiet
place. After a little while, my mom came into the room. She said that dad had just called again,
and they should be home in thirty minutes. She asked me if anything was wrong, and I knew that
she didn’t mean my sister, and I knew that she didn’t mean she and Dad fighting on the phone
46
because that stuff just happens sometimes. She just noticed that I looked very sad today, and she
didn’t think it was my friends leaving because I looked okay yesterday when I came back from sledding.
 “Is it your aunt Helen?”
 It was the way she said it that started me feeling.
 “Please, don’t do this to yourself, Charlie.”
 But I did do it to myself. Like I do every year on my birthday.
 “I’m sorry.”
 My mom wouldn’t let me talk about it. She knows that I stop listening and start to really breathe
fast. She covered my mouth and wiped at my eyes. I calmed down enough to make it downstairs.
And I calmed down enough to be glad when my brother came home. And when we ate dinner, it
wasn’t too dry. Then, we went outside to put up luminaria, which is an activity where all our neighbors
fill brown paper bags with sand and line the street with them. Then, we stick a candle in the
sand of each bag, and when we light the candles, it turns the street into a “landing strip” for Santa
Claus. I love putting luminaria up every year because it is very beautiful and a tradition and a good
distraction from my birthday.
 My family gave me some really nice birthday presents. My sister was still mad at me, but she got
me a Smiths record anyway. And my brother got me a poster signed by the whole football team.
My dad gave me some records that my sister told him to buy. And my mom gave me some of the
books she loved when she was a kid. One of them was The Catcher in the Rye.
 I started reading my mom’s copy from the place I left off with Bill’s copy. And it made me not
think about my birthday. All I thought was that I am going to take my driver’s test sometime soon
enough. That was a pretty good thing to think about. And then I thought about my driver’s education
class this past semester.
 Mr. Smith, who is kind of short and smells funny, wouldn’t let any of us turn on the radio as
we rode around. There were also two sophomores, one boy and one girl. They used to secretly
touch each other’s legs in the backseat when it was my turn. Then, there was me. I wish I had a lot
of stories about driver’s education class. Sure, there were these movies about death on the highway.
And sure there were police officers coming to talk to us. And sure it was fun to get my learner’s
permit, but Mom and Dad said they didn’t want me driving until I absolutely had to because insurance
is so expensive. And I could never ask Sam to drive her pickup truck. I just couldn’t.
 These kind of things kept me calm the night of my birthday.
 The next morning Christmas started out nice. Dad liked his copy of More”inA”inSo”inHave a
lot, which made me so happy, especially when he told his own story about that night we watched
it. He left out the part about him crying, but he winked at me, so I knew he remembered. Even
the two-hour drive to Ohio was actually okay for the first half hour, even though I had to sit on the
hump in the backseat, because my dad kept asking questions about college, and my brother kept
talking. He is dating one of those cheerleader girls who does flips during college football games.
Her name is Kelly. My dad was very interested in that. My sister made some remark about how
cheerleading is stupid and sexist, and my brother told her to shut up. Kelly was majoring in philoso-
47
phy. I asked my brother if Kelly was unconventionally beautiful.
 “No, she’s hot beautiful.”
 And my sister started talking about how the way a woman looks is not the most important thing.
I agreed, but then my brother started saying how my sister was just a “bitchy dyke.” Then, my mom
told my brother to not use such language in front of me, which was strange considering I am probably
the only one in the family with a friend who is gay. Maybe not, but one who actually talks
about it. I’m not sure. Regardless, my dad asked how my brother and Kelly met.
 My brother and Kelly met at a restaurant called Ye Olde College Inn or something like that at
Penn State. They supposedly have this famous dessert called “grilled stickies.” Anyway, Kelly was
with her sorority sisters, and they started to leave, and she dropped her book right in front of my
brother, and she kept walking. My brother said that although Kelly denies this, he’s sure that she
dropped the book on purpose. The leaves were in full bloom when he caught up with her in front
of the video arcade. That’s how he described it anyway. They spent the rest of the afternoon playing
old video games like Donkey Kong and feeling nostalgic, which as a general statement, I found
sad and sweet. I asked my brother if Kelly drank cocoa.
 “Are you high?”
 And again my mom asked my brother not to use such language in front of me, which was
strange again because I think I’m the only person in my family who’s ever been high. Maybe also
my brother. I’m not sure. Definitely not my sister. Then again, maybe my whole family has been
high, and we just don’t tell each other these things.
 My sister spent the next ten minutes denouncing the Greek system of sororities and fraternities.
She kept telling stories of “hazing” and how kids have died before. She then told this one
story about how she heard there was a sorority that made the new girls stand in their underwear
while they circled their “fat” in red magic markers. My brother had had enough of my sister at that
point.
 “Bullshit!”
 I still can’t believe that my brother swore in the car, and my dad or mom didn’t say anything. I
guess because he’s in college now, it’s all right. My sister didn’t care about the word. She just kept
going.
 “It’s not bullshit. I heard it.”
 “Watch your mouth, young lady,” my dad said from the front seat.
 “Oh, yeah? Where did you hear it?” my brother asked.
 “I heard it on National Public Radio,” my sister said.
 “Oh, Jesus.” My brother has a very full laugh.
 “Well, I did.”
 My mom and dad looked like they were watching a tennis match through the windshield because
they just kept shaking their heads. They didn’t say anything. They didn’t look back. I should point
out, though, that my dad slowly started turning the Christmas music on the radio to a deafening
48
volume.
 “You are so full of shit. How would you know anything anyway? You haven’t been to college.
Kelly didn’t go through anything like that.”
 “Oh, yeah ... like she’d tell you.”
 “Yeah ... she would. We don’t keep secrets.”
 “Oh, you’re such a sensitive new age guy.”
 I wanted them to stop fighting because I was starting to get upset, so I asked another question.
 “Do you talk about books and issues?”
 “Thank you for asking, Charlie. Yes. As a matter of fact we do. Kelly’s favorite book just happens
to be Walden by Henry David Thoreau. And Kelly just happened to say that the transcendental
movement is a close parallel to this day and age.”
 “Oooo. Big words.” My sister rolls her eyes better than anyone.
 “Oh, I’m sorry. Was anyone talking to you? I happen to be telling my younger brother about my
girlfr. Kelly says that she hopes a good Democratic candidate will challenge George Bush. Kelly
says that her hope is that the E.R.A. might finally pass if that happens. That’s right. The E.R.A.
that you always squawk about. Even cheerleaders think about those things. And they can actually
have fun in the meantime.”
 My sister folded her arms in front of her and started whistling. My brother was too much on a
roll to stop, though. I noticed that my dad’s neck was getting very red.
 “But there’s another difference between you and her. You see ... Kelly believes in women’s
rights so much that she would never let a guy hit her. I guess I can’t say that about you.”
 I swear to God, we almost died. My dad hit those brakes so hard that my brother almost flew
over the seat. When the smell from the tires started to fade, my dad took a deep breath and turned
around. First, he turned to my brother. He didn’t say a word. He just stared.
 My brother looked at my dad like a deer caught by my cousins. After a long two seconds, my
brother turned to my sister. I think he felt bad about it because of how the words came out.
 “I’m sorry. Okay? I mean it. Can’mon. Stop crying.”
 My sister was crying so hard, it was scary. Then, my dad turned to my sister. Again, he didn’t
say a word. He just snapped his fingers to distract her from crying. She looked at him. She
was confused at first because he wasn’t giving her a warm look. But then, she looked down and
shrugged and turned to my brother.
 “I’m sorry I said what I said about Kelly. She sounds nice.”
 Then, my dad turned to my mom. And my mom turned to us.
 “Your father and I don’t want any more fighting. Especially in the family’s house. Understood?”
 My mom and dad make a real team sometimes. It’s amazing to watch. My brother and sister
both nodded and looked down. Then, my dad turned to me.
49
 “Charlie?”
from
 “Yes, sir?”
 It is important to say “sir” at these moments. And if they ever call you by your first-middle-last
name, you better watch out. I’m telling you.
 “Charlie, I would like you to drive the rest of the way to my mother’s house.”
 Everyone in the car knew that this was probably the worst idea my dad ever had in his whole
life. But no one argued. He got out of the car in the middle of the road. He got in the backseat
between my brother and sister. I climbed in the front seat, stalled the car twice, and put on my seat
belt. I drove the rest of the way. I haven’t sweat that much since I played sports, and it was cold
out.
 My dad’s family is kind of like my mom’s family. My brother once said it was like the same
cousins with different names. The big difference is my grandma. I love my grandma. Everyone
loves my grandma. She was waiting for us in the driveway as she always did. She always knew
when someone was coming.
 “Is Charlie driving now?”
 “He turned sixteen yesterday.”
 “Oh.”
 My grandma is very old, and she doesn’t remember things a lot, but she bakes the most delicious
cookies. When I was very little, we had my mom’s mom, who always had candy, and my dad’s mom,
who always had cookies. My mom told me that when I was little, I called them “Candy Grandma”
and “Cookies Grandma.” I also called pizza crust “pizza bones.” I don’t know why I’m telling you
this.
 It’s like my very first memory, which I guess is the first time I was aware that I was alive. My
mom and my Aunt Helen took me to the zoo. I think I was three. I don’t remember that part.
Anyway, we were watching these two cows. A mother cow and its baby calf. And they didn’t have
a lot of room to walk around. Anyway, the baby calf was standing right underneath its mother, just
kind of walking around, and the mother cow took a “dump” on the baby calf ’s head. I thought it
was the funniest thing I had ever seen in the whole world, and I laughed about it for three hours.
At first, my mom and Aunt Helen kind of laughed, too, because they were happy that I was laughing.
Supposedly, I didn’t talk hardly at all when I was a little kid, and whenever I seemed normal,
they were happy. But into the third hour, they were trying to make me stop laughing, but it only
made me laugh harder. I don’t think it was really three hours, but it seemed like a long time. I still
think about it every now and then. It seems like a rather “auspicious” beginning.
 After hugs and handshakes, we went into my grandma’s house, and the whole dad-side-of-thefamily
was there. Great Uncle Phil with his fake teeth and my aunt Rebecca, who is my dad’s sister.
Mom told us that Aunt Rebecca just got divorced again, so we shouldn’t mention anything. All I
could think about was the cookies, but Grandma didn’t make them this year because of her bad
hip.
50
 We all sat down and watched television instead, and my cousins and my brother talked about
football. And my Great Uncle Phil drank. And we ate dinner. And I had to sit at the little kids’
table because there are more cousins on my dad’s side of the family.
 Little kids talk about the strangest things. They really do.
 After dinner is when we watched It’s a Wonderful Life, and I started feeling more and more sad.
As I was walking up the stairs to my dad’s old room, and I was looking at the old photographs, I
started thinking that there was a time when these weren’t memories. That someone actually took
that photograph, and the people in the photograph had just eaten lunch or something.
 My grandma’s first husband died in Korea. My dad and my aunt Rebecca were very young. And
my grandma moved with her two kids to live with her brother, my great uncle Phil.
 Finally, after a few years, my grandma was feeling very sad because she had these two little kids,
and she was tired from waitressing all the time. So, one day, she was working at this diner where
she worked, and this truck driver asked her on a date. My grandma was very very pretty in that old
photograph kind of way. They dated for a while. And finally they got married. He turned out to
be a terrible person. He hit my dad all the time. And he hit my aunt Rebecca all the time. And he
really hit my grandma. All the time. And my grandma really couldn’t do anything about it, I guess,
because it went on for seven years.
 It ended finally when my great uncle Phil saw bruises on my aunt Rebecca and finally got the
truth out of my grandma. Then, he got a few of his friends together from the factory. And they
found my grandma’s second husband in a bar. And they beat him up really bad. My great uncle
Phil loves to tell the story when my grandma isn’t around. The story keeps changing, but the main
point is still the same. The guy died four days later in the hospital.
 I still don’t know how my great uncle Phil missed going to jail for doing what he did. I asked
my dad once, and he said that the people that lived around his neighborhood understood that some
things had nothing to do with the police. He said that if someone touched your sister or your
mother, they paid the price, and everyone looked the other way.
 It’s just too bad that it went on for seven years because my aunt Rebecca went through the same
kind of husbands. My aunt Rebecca had it different, though, because neighborhoods change. My
great uncle Phil was too old, and my dad left his hometown. She had to get restraining orders instead.
 I think about what my three cousins, who are Aunt Rebecca’s children, will turn out like. One
girl and two boys. I get sad, too, because I think that the one girl will probably end up like my aunt
Rebecca, and the one boy will probably end up like his dad. The other boy might end up like my
dad because he can really play sports, and he had a different dad than his brother or sister. My dad
talks to him a lot and teaches him how to throw and hit a baseball. I used to get jealous about this
when I was a little kid, but I don’t anymore. Because my brother said that my cousin is the only
one in his family who has ad chance. He needs my dad. I guess I understand that now.
 My dad’s old room is very much the way he left it, except more faded. There is a globe on a
desk that has been spun a lot. And there are old posters of baseball players. And old press clippings
of my dad winning the big game when he was a sophomore. I don’t know why, but I really
51
understood why my dad had to leave this house. When he knew my grandma would never find
another man because she was through trusting and would never look for anything else because she
didn’t know how. And when he saw his sister start bringing home younger versions of their stepfather
to date. He just couldn’t stay.
 I laid down on his old bed, and I looked through the window at this tree that was probably a
lot shorter when my dad looked at it. And I could feel what he felt on the night when he realized
that if he didn’t leave, it would never be his life. It would be theirs. At least that’s how he’s put it.
Maybe that’s why my dad’s side of the family watches the same movie every year. It makes sense
enough. I should probably mention that my dad never cries at the ending.
 I don’t know if my grandma or Aunt Rebecca will ever really forgive my dad for leaving them.
Only my great uncle Phil understood that part. It’s always strange to see how my dad changes
around his mom and sister. He feels bad all the time, and his sister and he always take a walk alone
together. One time, I looked out the window, and I saw my dad giving her money.
 I wonder what my aunt Rebecca says in the car on the way home. I wonder what her children
think. I wonder if they talk about us. I wonder if they look at my family and wonder who has a
chance to make it. I bet they do.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 26, 1991 Dear friend,
 I am sitting in my bedroom now after the two-hour ride back to my house. My sister and brother
were nice to each other, so I didn’t have to drive.
 Usually, on the way home, we drive to visit my Aunt Helen’s grave. It’s kind of a tradition. My
brother and my dad never want to go that much, but they know not to say anything because of
Mom and me. My sister is kind of neutral, but she is sensitive about certain things.
 Every time we go to see my Aunt Helen’s grave, my mom and I like to talk about something
really great about her. Most years it is about how she let me stay up and watch Saturday Night Live.
And my mom smiles because she knows if she was a kid, she would have wanted to stay up and
watch, too.
 We both put down flowers and sometimes a card. We just want her to know that we miss her,
and we think of her, and she was special. She didn’t get that enough when she was alive, my mom
always says. And like my dad, I think my mom feels guilty about it. So guilty that instead of giving
her money, she gave her a home to stay in.
 I want you to know why my mom is guilty. I should probably tell you why, but I really don’t
know if I should. I have to talk about it with someone. No one in my family will ever talk about it.
It’s just something they don’t. I’m talking about the bad thing that happened to Aunt Helen they
wouldn’t tell me about when I was little.
 Every time it comes to Christmas it’s all I can think about ... deep down. It is the one thing that
52
makes me deep down sad.
 I will not say who. I will not say when. I will just say that my aunt Helen was molested. I hate
that word. It was done by someone who was very close to her. It was not her dad. She finally told
her dad. He didn’t believe her because of who it was. A friend of the family. That just made it
worse. My grandma never said anything either. And the man kept coming over for visits.
 My aunt Helen drank a lot. My aunt Helen took drugs a lot. My aunt Helen had many problems
with men and boys. She was a very unhappy person most of her life. She went to hospitals
all the time. All kinds of hospitals. Finally, she went to a hospital that helped her figure things out
enough to try and make things normal, so she moved in with my family. She started taking classes
to get a good job. She told her last bad man to leave her alone. She started losing weight without
going on a diet. She took care of us, so my parents could go out and drink and play board games.
She let us stay up late. She was the only person other than my mom and dad and brother and sister
to buy me two presents. One for my birthday. One for Christmas. Even when she moved in with
the family and had no money. She always bought me two presents. They were always the best
presents.
 On December 24, 1983, a policeman came to the door. My aunt Helen was in a terrible car accident.
It was very snowy. The policeman told my mom that my aunt Helen had passed away. He
was a very nice man because when my mom started crying, he said that it was a very bad accident,
and my Aunt Helen was definitely killed instantly. In other words, there was no pain. There was no
pain anymore.
 The policeman asked my mom to come down and identify the body. My dad was still at work.
That was when I walked up with my brother and sister. It was my seventh birthday. We all wore
party hats. My mom made my sister and brother wear them. My sister saw Mom crying and asked
what was wrong. My mom couldn’t say anything. The policeman got on one knee and told us what
happened. My brother and sister cried. But I didn’t. I knew that the policeman made a mistake.
 My mom asked my brother and sister to take care of me and left with the policeman. I think we
watched TV. I don’t think I really remember. My dad came home before my mom.
 “Why the long faces?”
 We told him. He did not cry. He asked if we were okay. My brother and sister said no. I said
yes. The policeman just made a mistake. It is very snowy. He probably couldn’t see. My mom
came home. She was crying. She looked at my dad and nodded. My dad held her. That’s when I
figured out that the policeman didn’t make a mistake.
 I don’t really know what happened next, and I never really asked. I just remember going to the
hospital. I remember sitting in a room with bright lights. I remember a doctor asking me questions.
I remember telling him how Aunt Helen was the only one who hugged me. I remember
seeing my family on Christmas day in a waiting room. I remember not being allowed to go to the
funeral. I remember never saying good-bye to my Aunt Helen.
 I don’t know how long I kept going to the doctor. I don’t remember how long they kept me out
of school. It was a long time. I know that much. All I remember is the day I started getting better
because I remembered the last thing my Aunt Helen said just before she left to drive in the snow.
53
 She wrapped herself in a coat. I handed her the car keys because I was always the one who
could find them. I asked Aunt Helen where she was going. She told me that it was a secret. I kept
bugging my aunt Helen, which she loved. She loved the way I would keep asking her questions.
She finally shook her head, smiled, and whispered in my ear.
 “I’m going to buy your birthday present.”
 That’s the last time I ever saw her. I like to think my aunt Helen would now have that good job
she was studying for. I like to think she would have met a good man. I like to think she would
have lost the weight she always wanted to lose without dieting.
 Despite everything my mom and doctor and dad have said to me about blame, I can’t stop
thinking what I know. And I know that my aunt Helen would still be alive today if she just bought
me one present like everybody else. She would be alive if I were born on a day that didn’t snow. I
would do anything to make this go away. I miss her terribly. I have to stop writing now because I
am too sad.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 December 30, 1991 Dear friend,
 The day after I wrote to you, I finished The Catcher in the Rye. I have read it three times since.
I really didn’t know what else to do. Sam and Patrick are finally coming home tonight, but I won’t
get to see them. Patrick is going to meet Brad somewhere. Sam is going to meet Craig. I’ll see
them both tomorrow at the Big Boy and then at Bob’s New Year’s Eve party.
 The exciting part is that I’m going to drive to the Big Boy by myself. My dad said I couldn’t
drive until the weather cleared up, and it finally did a little bit yesterday. I made a mix tape for the
occasion. It is called “The First Time I Drove.” Maybe I’m being too sentimental, but I like to
think that when I’m old, I will be able to look at all these tapes and remember those drives.
 The first time I drove alone was to see my aunt Helen. It was the first time I ever went to see
her without at least my mom. I made it a special time. I bought flowers with my Christmas money.
I even made her a mix tape and left it at the grave. I hope you do not think that makes me weird.
 I told my aunt Helen all about my life. About Sam and Patrick. About their friends. About my
first New Year’s Eve party tomorrow. I told her about how my brother would be playing his last
football game of the season on New Year’s Day. I told her about my brother leaving and how my
mom cried. I told her about the books I read. I told her about the song “Asleep.” I told her when
we all felt infinite. I told her about me getting my driver’s license. How my mom drove us there.
And how I drove us back. And how the policeman who ran the test didn’t even look weird or have
a funny name, which felt like a gyp to me.
 I remember when I was just about to say good-bye to my aunt Helen, I started crying. It was a
real kind of crying, too. Not the panicky type, which I do a lot. And I made Aunt Helen a promise
to only cry about important things because I would hate to think that crying as much as I do would
54
make crying for Aunt Helen less than it is.
 Then, I said good-bye, and I drove home.
 I read the book again that night because I knew that if I didn’t, I would probably start crying
again. The panicky type, I mean. I read until I was completely exhausted and had to go to sleep.
In the morning, I finished the book and then started immediately reading it again. Anything to
not feel like crying. Because I made the promise to Aunt Helen. And because I don’t want to start
thinking again. Not like I have this last week. I can’t think again. Not ever again.
 I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or
just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that
is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it
all to stop spinning. If this gets any worse, I might have to go back to the doctor. It’s getting that
bad again.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 January 1, 1992 Dear friend,
 It’s now 4 o’clock in the morning, which is the new year even though it’s still December 31, that
is, until people sleep. I can’t sleep. Everyone else is either asleep or having sex. I’ve been watching
cable television and eating jello. And seeing things move. I wanted to tell you about Sam and
Patrick and Craig and Brad and Bob and everyone, but I can’t remember right now.
 It’s peaceful outside. I do know that. And I drove to the Big Boy earlier. And I saw Sam and
Patrick. And they were with Brad and Craig. And it made me very sad because I wanted to be
alone with them. This has never come up before.
 Things were worse an hour ago, and I was looking at this tree but it was a dragon and then a
tree, and I remembered that one nice pretty weather day when I was part of the air. And I remembered
that I mowed the lawn that day for my allowance just like I shovel the driveway for my allowance
now. So I started shoveling Bob’s driveway, which is a strange thing to do at a New Year’s Eve
party really.
 My cheeks were red cold just like Mr. Z’s drinking face and his black shoes and his voice saying
when a caterpillar goes into a cocoon, it goes through torture and how it takes seven years to
digest gum. And this one kid Mark at the party who gave me this came out of nowhere and looked
at the sky and told me to see the stars. So, I looked up, and we were in this giant dome like a glass
snowball, and Mark said that the amazing white stars were really only holes in the black glass of the
dome, and when you went to heaven, the glass broke away, and there was nothing but a whole sheet
of star white, which is brighter than anything but doesn’t hurt your eyes. It was vast and open and
thinly quiet, and I felt so small.
 Sometimes, I look outside, and I think that a lot of other people have seen this snow before.
Just like I think that a lot of other people have read those books before. And listened to those
55
songs.
 I wonder how they feel tonight.
 I don’t really know what I’m saying. I probably shouldn’t write this down because I’m still seeing
things move. I want them to stop moving, but they’re not supposed to for another few hours.
That’s what Bob said before he went to his bedroom with Jill, a girl that I don’t know.
 I guess what I’m saying is that this all feels very familiar. But it’s not mine to be familiar about.
I just know that another kid has felt this. This one time when it’s peaceful outside, and you’re seeing
things move, and you don’t want to, and everyone is asleep. And all the books you’ve read have
been read by other people. And all the songs you’ve loved have been heard by other people. And
that girl that’s pretty to you is pretty to other people. And you know that if you looked at these
facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing “unity.”
 It’s like when you are excited about a girl and you see a couple holding hands, and you feel so
happy for them. And other times you see the same couple, and they make you so mad. And all you
want is to always feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means that you’re
happy, too.
 I just remembered what made me think of all this. I’m going to write it down because maybe if
I do I won’t have to think about it. And I won’t get upset. But the thing is that I can hear Sam and
Craig having sex, and for the first time in my life, I understand the end of that poem.
 And I never wanted to. You have to believe me.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 Part 3
 January 4, 1992 Dear friend,
 I’m sorry for that last letter. To tell you the truth, I don’t really remember much of it, but I
know from how I woke up that it probably wasn’t very nice. All I remember from the rest of that
night was looking all over the house for an envelope and a stamp. When I finally found them, I
wrote your address and walked down the hill past the trees to the post office because I knew that if
I didn’t put it in a mailbox that I couldn’t get it back from, I would never mail the letter.
 It’s weird how important it seemed at the time.
 Once I got to the post office, I dropped the letter into the mailbox. And it felt final. And calm.
Then, I started throwing up, and I didn’t stop throwing up until the sun came up. I looked at the
road and saw a lot of cars, and I knew they were all going to their grandparents’ house. And I knew
a lot of them would watch my brother play football later that day. And my mind played hopscotch.
 My brother ... football ... Brad ... Dave and his girlfr in my room ... the coats ... the cold ...
the winter ... “Autumn Leaves” ... don’t tell anyone ... you pervert ... Sam and Craig ... Sam ...
Christmas ... typewriter ... gift ... Aunt Helen ... and the trees kept moving ... they just wouldn’t
56
stop moving ... so I laid down and made a snow angel.
 The policemen found me pale blue and asleep.
 I didn’t stop shivering from the cold until a long time after my mom and dad drove me home
from the emergency room. Nobody got in trouble because these things used to happen to me
when I was a kid when I was seeing the doctors. I would just wander off and fall asleep somewhere.
Everyone knew I went to a party, but nobody, not even my sister, thought it was because
of that. And I kept my mouth shut because I didn’t want Sam or Patrick or Bob or anyone to get
in trouble. But most of all, I didn’t want to see my mother’s face and especially my father’s if they
heard me say the truth.
 So, I didn’t say anything.
 I just kept quiet and looked around. And I noticed things. The dots on the ceiling. Or how the
blanket they gave me was rough. Or how the doctor’s face looked rubbery. Or how everything was
a deafening whisper, when he said that maybe I should start seeing a psychiatrist again. It was the
first time a doctor ever told that to my parents with me in the room. And his coat was so white.
And I was so tired.
 All I could think through the whole day was that we missed my brother’s football game because
of me, and I really hoped my sister thought to tape it.
 Luckily, she did.
 We got home, and my mom made me some tea, and my dad asked me if I wanted to sit and
watch the game, and I said yes. We watched my brother make a great play, but this time, nobody
really cheered. All corners of all eyes were on me. And my mom said a lot of encouraging things
about how I was doing so well this school year and maybe the doctor would help me sort things
out. My mom can be quiet and talk at the same time when she’s being positive. My dad kept giving
me “love pats.” Love pats are soft punches of encouragement that are administered on the knee,
shoulder, and arm. My sister said that she could help me fix up my hair. It was weird to have them
pay so much attention to me.
 “What do you mean? What’s wrong with my hair?”
 My sister just kind of looked around, uncomfortable. I reached my hands up to my hair and realized
that a lot of it was gone. I honestly don’t remember when I did it, but from the look of my
hair, I must have grabbed a pair of scissors and just started cutting without strategy. Big chunks of
it were missing all over the place. It was like a butcher’s cut. I hadn’t looked at myself in the mirror
at the party for a long time because my face was different and frightened me. Or else I would have
noticed.
 My sister did help me trim it up a bit, and I was lucky because everyone in school including Sam
and Patrick thought it looked cool.
 “Chic” was Patrick’s word.
 Regardless, I decided to never take LSD again.
 Love always,
 Charlie
57
 January 14, 1992 Dear friend,
 I feel like a big faker because I’ve been putting my life back together, and nobody knows. It’s
hard to sit in my bedroom and read like I always did. It’s even hard to talk to my brother on the
phone. His team finished third in the nation. Nobody told him we missed the game live because
of me.
 I went to the library and checked out a book because I was getting scared. Every now and then
things would start moving again, and sounds were bass heavy and hollow. And I couldn’t put a
thought together. The book said that sometimes people take LSD, and they don’t really get out of
it. They said that it increases this one type of brain transmitter. They said that essentially the drug
is twelve hours of schizophrenia, and if you already have a lot of this brain transmitter, you don’t
get out of it.
 I started breathing fast in the library. It was really bad because I remembered some of the
schizophrenic kids in the hospital when I was little. And it didn’t help that this was the day after I
noticed that all the kids were wearing their new Christmas clothes, so I decided to wear my new suit
from Patrick to school, and was teased mercilessly for nine straight hours. It was such a bad day. I
skipped my first class ever and went to see Sam and Patrick outside.
 “Looking sharp, Charlie,” Patrick said grinning.
 “Can I have a cigarette?” I said. I couldn’t bring myself to say “bum a smoke.” Not for my first
one. I just couldn’t.
 “Sure,” said Patrick.
 Sam stopped him.
 “What’s wrong, Charlie?”
 I told them what was wrong, which prompted Patrick to keep asking me if I had a “bad trip.”
 “No. No. It’s not that.” I was really getting upset.
 Sam put her arm around my shoulder, and she said she knew what I was going through. She
told me I shouldn’t worry about it. Once you do it, you remember how things looked on it. That’s
all. Like how the road turned into waves. And how your face was plastic and your eyes were two
different sizes. It’s all in your mind.
 That’s when she gave me the cigarette.
 When I lit it, I didn’t cough. It actually felt soothing. I know that’s bad in a health class way, but
it was true.
 “Now, focus on the smoke,” Sam said.
 And I focused on the smoke.
 “Now, that looks normal doesn’t it?”
 “Uh-huh,” I think I said.
58
 “Now, look at the cement on the playground. Is it moving?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Okay ... now focus on the piece of paper that’s just sitting there on the ground.”
 And I focused on the piece of paper that was sitting on the ground.
 “Is the cement moving now?”
 “No. It’s not.”
 From there you go, to you’re going to be okay, to you probably should never do acid again,
Sam went on to explain what she called “the trance.” The trance happens when you don’t focus on
anything, and the whole big picture swallows and moves around you. She said it was usually metaphoric,
but for people who should never do acid again, it was literal.
 That’s when I started laughing. I was so relieved. And Sam and Patrick smiled. I was glad they
started smiling, too, because I couldn’t stand their looking so worried.
 Things have stopped moving for the most part ever since. I haven’t skipped another class. And
I guess now I don’t feel like a big faker for trying to put my life back together. Bill thought my paper
on The Catcher in the Rye (which I wrote on my new old typewriter!) was my best one yet. He
said I was “developing” at a rapid pace and gave me a different kind of book as “a reward.” It’s On
the Road by Jack Kerouac.
 I’m now up to about ten cigarettes a day.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 January 25, 1992 Dear friend,
 I feel great! I really mean it. I have to remember this for the next time I’m having a terrible
week. Have you ever done that? You feel really bad, and then it goes away, and you don’t know
why. I try to remind myself when I feel great like this that there will be another terrible week coming
someday, so I should store up as many great details as I can, so during the next terrible week, I
can remember those details and believe that I’ll feel great again. It doesn’t work a lot, but I think
it’s very important to try.
 My psychiatrist is a very nice man. He’s much better than my last psychiatrist. We talk about
things that I feel and think and remember. Like when I was little, and there was this one time that
I walked down the street in my neighborhood. I was completely naked, holding a bright blue umbrella,
even though it wasn’t raining. And I was so happy because it made my mom smile. And she
rarely smiled. So, she took a picture. And the neighbors complained.
 This other time, I saw a commercial for this movie about a man who was accused of murder,
but he didn’t commit the murder. A guy from More”inA”inSo”inHave was the star of the movie.
That’s probably why I remember it. The commercial said that the whole movie was about him
trying to prove that he was innocent and how he could go to jail anyway. That scared me a lot. It
59
scared me how much it scared me. Being punished for something you did not do. Or being an innocent
victim. It’s just something that I never want to experience.
 I don’t know if it is important to tell you all this, but at the time, it felt like a “breakthrough.”
 The best thing about my psychiatrist is that he has music magazines in his waiting room. I read
an article about Nirvana on one visit, and it didn’t have any references to honey mustard dressing
or lettuce. They kept talking about the singer’s stomach problems all the time, though. It was
weird.
 Like I told you, Sam and Patrick love their big song, so I thought I’d read it to have something
to discuss with them. In the end, the magazine compared him with John Lennon from the Beatles.
I told that to Sam later, and she got really mad. She said he was like Jim Morrison if he was like
anybody, but really, he isn’t like anybody but himself. We were all at the Big Boy after Rocky Horror,
and it started this big discussion.
 Craig said the problem with things is that everyone is always comparing everyone with everyone
and because of that, it discredits people, like in his photography classes.
 Bob said that it was all about our parents not wanting to let go of their youth and how it kills
them when they can’t relate to something.
 Patrick said that the problem was that since everything has happened already, it makes it hard to
break new ground. Nobody can be as big as the Beatles because the Beatles already gave it a “context.”
The reason they were so big is that they had no one to compare themselves with, so the sky
was the limit.
 Sam added that nowadays a band or someone would compare themselves to the Beatles after
the second album, and their own personal voice would be less from that moment on.
 “What do you think, Charlie?”
 I couldn’t remember where I heard it or read it. I said maybe it was in This Side of Paradise by
From. Scott Fitzgerald. There’s a place near the end of the book where the main kid is picked up
by some older gentleman. They are both going to an Ivy League homecoming football game, and
they have this debate. The older gentleman is established. The kid is “jaded.”
 Anyway, they have this discussion, and the kid is an idealist in a temporary way. He talks about
his “restless generation” and things like that. And he says something like, “This is not a time for
heroes because nobody will let that happen.” The book takes place in the 1920’s, which I thought
was great because I supposed the same kind of conversation could happen in the Big Boy. It probably
already did with our parents and grandparents. It was probably happening with us right now.
 So, I said I thought the magazine was trying to make him a hero, but then later somebody might
dig up something to make him seem like less than a person. And I didn’t know why because to me
he is just a guy who writes songs that a lot of people like, and I thought that was enough for everyone
involved. Maybe I’m wrong, but everyone at the table starting talking about it.
 Sam blamed television. Patrick blamed government. Craig blamed the “corporate media.” Bob
was in the bathroom.
 I don’t know what it was, and I know we didn’t really accomplish anything, but it felt great to
60
sit there and talk about our place in things. It was like when Bill told me to “participate.” I went to
the homecoming dance like I told you before, but this was much more fun. It was especially fun to
think that people all over the world were having similar conversations in their equivalent of the Big
Boy.
 I would have told the table that, but they were really having fun being cynical, and I didn’t want
to ruin it. So, I just sat back a little bit and watched Sam sitting next to Craig and tried not to be
too sad about it. I have to say that I couldn’t do it very successfully. But at one point, Craig was
talking about something, and Sam turned to me and smiled. It was a movie smile in slow motion,
and then everything was okay.
 I told this to my psychiatrist, but he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions.
 I don’t know. I just had a great day. I hope you did, too.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 February 2, 1992 Dear friend,
 On the Road was a very good book. Bill didn’t ask me to write a paper about it because, like I
said, it was “a reward.” He did ask me to visit him in his office after school to discuss it, which I
did. He made tea, and I felt like a grown-up. He even let me smoke a cigarette in his office, but he
urged me to quit smoking because of the health risks. He even had a pamphlet in his desk that he
gave me. I now use it as a bookmark.
 I thought Bill and I were going to talk about the book, but we ended up talking about “things.”
It was great to have so many discussions back-to-back. Bill asked me about Sam and Patrick and
my parents, and I told him about getting my license and talking in the Big Boy. I also told him
about my psychiatrist. I didn’t tell him about the party or my sister and her boyfriend, though.
They’re still seeing each other in secret, which my sister says only “adds to their passion.”
 After I got through telling Bill about my life, I asked him about his. It was nice, too, because
he didn’t try to be cool and relate to me or anything. He was just himself about it. He said that he
studied undergraduate work at some college in the West that doesn’t give grades, which I thought
was peculiar, but Bill said it was the best education he ever got. He said he’d give me a brochure
when the time was right.
 After he went to Brown University for graduate school, Bill traveled around Europe for a while,
and when he came home, he joined Teach for America. When this year is over, he thinks he is
going to move to New York and write plays. I guess he’s still pretty young, although I thought
it would be rude to ask him. I did ask him if he had a girlfr, though, and he said he didn’t. He
seemed sad when he said it, too, but I decided not to pry because I thought that would be too personal.
Then, he gave me my next book to read. It’s called Naked Lunch.
 I started reading it when I got home, and to tell you the truth, I don’t know what the guy is
talking about. I would never tell Bill this. Sam told me that William So. Burroughs wrote the book
61
when he was on heroin and that I should “go with the flow.” So, I did. I still had no idea what he
was talking about, so I went downstairs to watch television with my sister.
 The show was Gomer Pyle, and my sister was very quiet and moody. I tried to talk to her, but
she just told me to shut up and leave her alone. So, I watched the show for a few minutes, but it
made even less sense to me than the book, so I decided to do my math homework, which was a
mistake because math has never made any sense to me.
 I was just confused all day.
 So, I tried to help my mother in the kitchen, but I dropped the casserole, so she told me to read
in my room until my father came home, but reading is what started this whole mess in the first
place. Luckily, my father came home before I could pick up the book again, but he told me to stop
“hanging on his shoulders like a monkey” because he wanted to watch the hockey game. I watched
the hockey game with him for a while, but I couldn’t stop asking him questions about which countries
the players are from, and he was “resting his eyes,” which means he was sleeping but didn’t
want me to change the channel. So, he told me to go watch television with my sister, which I did,
but she told me to go help my mother in the kitchen, which I did, but then she told me to go read
in my room. Which I did.
 I’ve read about a third of the book now, and it’s pretty good so far.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 February 8, 1992 Dear friend,
 I have a date for the Sadie Hawkins’ dance. In case you didn’t have one of those, it’s the dance
where the girl asks the boy. In my case, the girl is Mary Elizabeth, and the boy is me. Can you believe
it?!
 I think it started when I was helping Mary Elizabeth staple the latest issue of Punk Rocky on
Friday before we went to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Mary Elizabeth was so nice that day.
She said that it was the best issue we’d ever had for two reasons, and both of those reasons were
mine.
 First of all, it was in color, and second, it had the poem that I gave Patrick in it.
 It really was a great issue. I think I’ll even think so when I’m older. Craig included some of
his color photographs. Sam included some “underground” news on some bands. Mary Elizabeth
wrote an article about the Democratic candidates. Bob included a reprint of a pro-hemp pamphlet.
And Patrick made this fake coupon advertising a free “blow job” for anyone who buys a Smiley
Cookie at the Big Boy. Some restrictions apply!
 There was even a nude photograph (from the back) of Patrick if you can believe it. Sam had
Craig take the picture. Mary Elizabeth told everyone to keep it a secret that the photograph was
Patrick, which everybody did, except Patrick.
62
 All night, he kept yelling, “Flaunt it, baby! Flaunt it!” which is his favorite line from his favorite
movie, The Producers.
 Mary Elizabeth told me she thought that Patrick asked her to put the photograph in the issue
so Brad could have a photograph of him without it being suspicious, but he wouldn’t say for sure.
Brad bought a copy without even looking at it, so maybe she was right.
 When I went to The Rocky Horror Picture Show that night, Mary Elizabeth was really mad
because Craig didn’t show up. Nobody knew why. Not even Sam. The problem was nobody was
there to play Rocky, the muscular robot (I’m not quite sure what he is). After looking around at
everybody, Mary Elizabeth turned to me.
 “Charlie, how many times have you seen the show?”
 “Ten.”
 “Do you think you can play Rocky?”
 “I’m not cut and hunky.”
 “It doesn’t matter. Can you play him?”
 “I guess.”
 “Do you guess or do you know?”
 “I guess.”
 “Good enough.”
 The next thing I know, I was wearing nothing but slippers and a bathing suit, which somebody
painted gold. I don’t know how these things happen to me sometimes. I was very nervous, especially
because in the show, Rocky has to touch Janet all over her body, and Sam was playing Janet.
Patrick kept making jokes that I would get an “erection.” I really hoped this wouldn’t happen.
Once, I got an erection in class and had to go to the blackboard. It was a terrible time. And when
my mind took that experience and added a spotlight and the fact that I was only wearing a bathing
suit, I panicked. I almost didn’t do the show, but then Sam told me she really wanted me to play
Rocky, and I guess that’s all I really needed to hear.
 I won’t go into detail about the whole show, but I had the best time I ever had in my whole life.
I’m not kidding. I got to pretend that I was singing, and I got to dance around, and I got to wear a
“feather boa” in the grande finale, which I wouldn’t have thought anything of because it’s part of
the show, but Patrick couldn’t stop talking about it.
 “Charlie in a feather boa! Charlie in a feather boa!” He just couldn’t stop laughing.
 But the best part was the scene with Janet where we had to touch each other. It wasn’t the
best part because I got to touch Sam and have her touch me. It’s the exact opposite. I know that
sounds dumb, but it’s true. Just before the scene, I thought about Sam, and I thought that if I
touched her in that way on stage and meant it, it would be cheap. And as much as I think I might
want to someday touch her like that, I never want it to be cheap. I don’t want it to be Rocky and
Janet. I want it to be Sam and I. And I want her to mean it back. So, we just played.
 When the show was over, we all bowed together, and there was applause everywhere. Patrick
63
even shoved me in front of the rest of the cast to take my own personal bow. I think this is the
initiation for new cast members. All I could think was how nice it was that everyone applauded for
me and how glad I was that nobody in my family was there to see me play Rocky in a feather boa.
Especially my dad.
 I did get an erection, though, but not until later, in the parking lot of the Big Boy.
 That’s when Mary Elizabeth asked me to the Sadie Hawkins’ dance after she said, “You looked
really good in your costume.”
 I like girls. I really do. Because they can think you look good in a bathing suit even when you
don’t. The erection made me feel guilty in hindsight though, but I guess it couldn’t be helped.
 I told my sister about having a date for the dance, but she was really distracted. Then, I tried
to ask her advice about how to treat a girl on a date since I’ve never had a date before, but she
wouldn’t answer. She wasn’t being mean. She was just “staring off into space.” I asked her if she
was okay, and she said that she needed to be alone, so I went up and finished Naked Lunch.
 After I finished, I just laid around in my bed, looking at the ceiling, and I smiled because it was a
nice kind of quiet.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 February 9, 1992 Dear friend,
 I have to say something about my last letter. I know that Sam would never ask me to the dance.
I know that she would bring Craig, and if not Craig, then Patrick since Brad’s girlfr, Nancy, is going
with Brad. I think Mary Elizabeth is a really smart and pretty person, and I’m glad that she is my
first date ever. But after I said yes, and Mary Elizabeth announced it to the group, I wanted Sam to
be jealous. I know it’s wrong to want something like that, but I really did.
 Sam wasn’t jealous, though. To tell you the truth, I don’t think she could have been happier
about it, which was hard.
 She even told me how to treat a girl on a date, which was very interesting. She said that with a
girl like Mary Elizabeth, you shouldn’t tell her she looks pretty. You should tell her how nice her
outfit is because her outfit is her choice whereas her face isn’t. She also said that with some girls,
you should do things like open car doors and buy flowers, but with Mary Elizabeth (especially since
it’s the Sadie Hawkins’ dance), I shouldn’t do that. So, I asked her what I should do, and she said
that I should ask a lot of questions and not mind when Mary Elizabeth doesn’t stop talking. I said
that it didn’t sound very democratic, but Sam said she does it all the time with boys.
 Sam did say that sex things were tricky with Mary Elizabeth since she’s had boyfriends before
and is a lot more experienced than I am. She said that the best thing to do when you don’t know
what to do during anything sexual is pay attention to how that person is kissing you and kiss them
back the same way. She says that is very sensitive, which I certainly want to be.
64
 So, I said, “Can you show me?”
 And she said, “Don’t be smart.”
 We talk to each other like that every now and then. It always makes her laugh. After Sam
showed me a Zippo lighter trick, I asked her more about Mary Elizabeth.
 “What if I don’t want to do anything sexual with her?”
 “Just say you’re not ready.”
 “Does that work?”
 “Sometimes.”
 I wanted to ask Sam about the other side of “sometimes,” but I didn’t want to be too personal,
and I didn’t want to know deep down. I wish I could stop being in love with Sam. I really do.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 February 15, 1992 Dear friend,
 I don’t feel very well because everything is messy. I did go to the dance, and I did tell Mary Elizabeth
how nice her outfit was. I did ask her questions, and I let her talk the whole time. I learned a
lot about “objectification,” Native Americans, and the bourgeoisie.
 But most of all, I learned about Mary Elizabeth.
 Mary Elizabeth wants to go to Berkeley and get two degrees. One is for political science. The
other is for sociology with a minor concentration in women’s studies. Mary Elizabeth hates high
school and wants to explore lesbian relationships. I asked her if she thought girls were pretty, and
she looked at me like I was stupid and said, “That’s not the point.”
 Mary Elizabeth’s favorite movie is Reds. Her favorite book is an autobiography of a woman
who was a character in Reds. I can’t remember her name. Mary Elizabeth’s favorite color is green.
Her favorite season is spring. Her favorite ice cream flavor (she said she refuses to eat low-fat
frozen yogurt on principle alone) is Cherry Garcia. Her favorite food is pizza (half mushrooms,
half green peppers). Mary Elizabeth is a vegetarian, and she hates her parents. She is also fluent in
Spanish.
 The only thing she asked me the whole time was whether or not I wanted to kiss her good
night. When I said that I wasn’t ready, she said she understood and told me what a great time she
had. She said I was the most sensitive boy she’d ever met, which I didn’t understand because really
all I did was not interrupt her.
 Then, she asked me if I wanted to go out again sometime, which Sam and I hadn’t discussed, so
I wasn’t prepared to answer it. I said yes because I didn’t want to do anything wrong, but I don’t
think I can think of a whole other night’s worth of questions. I don’t know what to do. How
many dates can you go on and still not be ready to kiss? I don’t think I will ever be ready for Mary
65
Elizabeth. I’ll have to ask Sam about this.
 Incidentally, Sam took Patrick to the dance after Craig said he was too busy. I guess they had
a big fight about it. Finally, Craig said that he didn’t want to go to some stupid high school dance
since he had already graduated. At one point in the dance, Patrick went to the parking lot to get
stoned with his guidance counselor, and Mary Elizabeth was requesting that the deejay play some
girl bands, which left Sam and me alone.
 “Are you having a good time?”
 Sam didn’t answer right away. She just kind of looked sad.
 “Not really. Are you?”
 “I don’t know. This is my first date, so I don’t know what to compare it to.”
 “Don’t worry. You’ll do fine.”
 “Really?”
 “You want some punch?”
 “Sure.”
 With that, Sam left. She really did look sad, and I wished I could have made her feel better, but
sometimes, I guess you just can’t. So, I stood alone by the wall and watched the dance for a while.
I would describe it to you, but I think it’s the kind of thing where you have to be there or at least
know the people. But then again, maybe you knew the same people when you went to your high
school dances, if you know what I mean.
 The one different thing about this particular dance was my sister. She was with her boyfriend.
And during a slow song, it looked like they had a huge fight because he stopped looking at her, and
she rushed off the dance floor to where the bathrooms are. I tried to follow her, but she had too
much of a head start. She never came back to the dance, and her boyfriend eventually left.
 After Mary Elizabeth dropped me off, I went into the house and found my sister crying in the
basement. This was a different kind of crying. It kind of frightened me. I talked very quiet and
slow.
 “Are you okay?”
 “Leave me alone, Charlie.”
 “No, really. What’s wrong?”
 “You wouldn’t understand.”
 “I could try.”
 “That’s a laugh. That’s really a laugh.”
 “Do you want me to wake up Mom and Dad then?”
 “No.”
 “Well, maybe they could--”
 “CHARLIE! SHUT UP! OKAY?! JUST SHUT UP!”
66
 That’s when she really started crying. I didn’t want to make her feel worse, so I turned to leave
her alone. That’s when my sister started hugging me. She didn’t say anything. She just hugged me
tight and wouldn’t let go. So, I hugged her back. It was weird, too, because I’ve never hugged my
sister. Not when she wasn’t forced to anyway. After a while, she calmed down a bit and let go. She
took a deep breath and brushed off the hair that was sticking to her face.
 That’s when she told me she was pregnant.
 I would tell you about the rest of the night, but I honestly don’t remember much about it. It’s
all a very sad daze. I do know that her boyfriend said it wasn’t his baby, but my sister knew that it
was. And I do know that he broke up with her right there at the dance. My sister hasn’t told anybody
else about it because she doesn’t want it to get around. The only people who know are me,
her, and him. I’m not allowed to tell anyone we know. Not anyone. Not ever.
 I told my sister that after a while, she probably couldn’t hide it, but she said she wouldn’t let it
go that far. Since she was eighteen, she didn’t need Mom or Dad’s permission. All she needed was
someone to be with her next Saturday at the clinic. And that person was me.
 “It’s lucky I got my license now.”
 I said that to make her laugh. But she didn’t.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 February 23, 1992 Dear friend,
 I was sitting in the waiting room of the clinic. I had been there for an hour or so. I don’t remember
exactly how long. Bill had given me a new book to read, but I just couldn’t concentrate on
it. I guess it makes sense why not.
 Then, I tried to read some magazines, but again, I just couldn’t. It wasn’t so much that they
mentioned what the people were eating. It was all the magazine covers. Each one had a smiling
face, and every time it was a woman on the cover, she was showing her cleavage. I wondered if
those women wanted to do that to look pretty or if it was just part of the job. I wondered if they
had a choice or not if they wanted to be successful. I just couldn’t get that thought out of my
mind.
 I could almost see the photo shoot and the actress or model going to eat a “light lunch” with
her boyfriend afterward. I could see him asking her about her day, and how she wouldn’t think too
much of it, or maybe if it was her first magazine cover, how she would be very excited because she
was starting to become famous. I could see the magazine on the newsstands, and a lot of anonymous
eyes looking at it, and how some people would think it was very important. And then how a
girl like Mary Elizabeth would be very angry about the actress or model showing her cleavage along
with all the other actresses and models doing the same thing, while some photographer like Craig
would just look at the quality of the photograph. Then, I thought there would be some men who
would buy the magazine and masturbate to it. And I wondered what the actress or her boyfriend
67
thought about that, if they did at all. And then I thought that it was about time for me to stop
thinking because it wasn’t doing my sister any good.
 That’s when I started thinking about my sister.
 I thought about the time when she and her friends painted my fingernails, and how that was
okay because my brother wasn’t there. And the time she let me use her dolls to make up plays or
let me watch whatever I wanted to watch on TV. And when she started becoming a “young lady,”
and no one was allowed to look at her because she thought she was fat. And how she really wasn’t
fat. And how she was actually very pretty. And how different her face looked when she realized
boys thought she was pretty. And how different her face looked the first time she really liked a boy
who was not on a poster on her wall. And how her face looked when she realized she was in love
with that boy. And then I wondered how her face would look when she came out from behind
those doors.
 My sister was the one who told me where babies come from. My sister was also the one who
laughed when I immediately asked her where babies go to.
 When I thought that, I started to cry. But I couldn’t let anyone see me because if they did, they
might not let me drive her home, and they might call our parents. And I couldn’t let that happen
because my sister was counting on me, and this was the first time anyone ever counted on me for
anything. When I realized that this was the first time I cried since I made my aunt Helen the promise
not to cry unless it was for something important, I had to go outside because I couldn’t hide it
from anyone anymore.
 I must have been in the car for a long time because eventually my sister found me there. I was
chain-smoking cigarettes and crying still. My sister knocked on the window. I rolled it down. She
looked at me with this curious expression. Then, her curiosity turned to anger.
 “Charlie, are you smoking?!”
 She was so mad. I can’t tell you how mad she was.
 “I can’t believe you’re smoking!”
 That’s when I stopped crying. And started laughing. Because of all the things she could have
said right after she got out of there, she picked my smoking. And she got angry about it. And I
knew if my sister was angry, then her face wouldn’t be that different. And she would be okay.
 “I’m going to tell Mom and Dad, you know?”
 “No, you’re not.” God, I couldn’t stop laughing.
 When my sister thought about it for a second, I think she figured out why she wouldn’t tell
Mom or Dad. It’s like she suddenly remembered where we were and what had just happened and
how crazy our whole conversation was considering all that. Then, she started laughing.
 But the laughing made her feel sick, so I had to get out of the car and help her into the backseat.
I had already set up the pillow and blanket for her because we figured it was probably best for
her to sleep it off a little in the car before we went home.
 Just before she fell asleep, she said, “Well, if you’re going to smoke, crack the window at least.”
68
 Which made me start laughing again.
 “Charlie, smoking. I can’t believe it.”
 Which made me laugh harder, and I said, “I love you.”
 And my sister said, “I love you, too. Just stop it with the laughing already.”
 Eventually, my laughing turned into the occasional chuckle, and then it just stopped. I looked
back and saw that my sister was asleep. So, I started the car and turned on the heater, so she would
be warm. That’s when I started reading the book Bill gave me. It’s Walden by Henry David Thoreau,
which is my brother’s girlfr’s favorite book, so I was very excited to read it.
 When the sun went down, I put my smoking pamphlet on the page where I stopped reading
and started driving home. I stopped a few blocks from our house to wake up my sister and put the
blanket and pillow in the trunk. We pulled into the driveway. We got out. We went inside. And we
heard our mother and father’s voices from the top of the stairs.
 “Where have you two been all day?”
 “Yeah. Dinner’s almost ready.”
 My sister looked at me. I looked at her. She shrugged. So, I started talking a mile a minute
about how we saw a movie and how my sister taught me how to drive on the highways and how we
went to McDonald’s.
 “McDonald’s?! When?!”
 “Your mother cooked ribs, you know?” My father was reading the paper.
 As I talked, my sister went up to my father and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He didn’t look up
from his paper.
 “I know, but we didn’t go to McDonald’s until before the movie, and that was a while ago.”
 Then, my father said matter-of-factly, “What movie did you see?”
 I froze, but my sister came through with the name of a movie just before she kissed my mother
on the cheek. I had never heard of this movie.
 “Was it any good?”
 I froze again.
 My sister was so calm. “It was okay. Those ribs smell great.”
 “Yeah,” I said. Then, I thought of something to change the subject. “Hey, Dad. Is the hockey
game on tonight?”
 “Yeah, but you’re only allowed to watch it with me if you don’t ask any of your stupid questions.”
 “Okay, but can I ask one now before it starts?”
 “I don’t know. Can you?”
 “May I?” I asked, corrected.
 He grunted, “Go ahead.”
69
 “What do the players call a hockey puck again?”
 “A biscuit. They call it a biscuit.”
 “Great. Thanks.”
 From that moment and all through dinner, my parents didn’t ask any more questions about our
day, although my mom did say how glad she was that my sister and I were spending more time together.
 That night, after our parents went to sleep, I went down to the car and got the pillow and blanket
out of the trunk. I brought them to my sister in her room. She was pretty tired. And she spoke
very softly. She thanked me for the whole day. She said that I didn’t let her down. And she said
that she wanted it to be our little secret since she decided to tell her old boyfriend that the pregnancy
was a false alarm. I guess she just didn’t trust him with the truth anymore.
 Just after I turned out the lights and opened the door, I heard her say softly,
 “I want you to stop smoking, you hear?”
 “I hear.”
 “Because I really do love you, Charlie.”
 “I love you, too.”
 “I mean it.”
 “So do I.”
 “Okay, then. Good night.”
 “Good night.”
 That’s when I shut the door and left her to sleep.
 I didn’t feel like reading that night, so I went downstairs and watched a half-hour-long commercial
that advertised an exercise machine. They kept flashing a 1-800 number, so I called it. The
woman who picked up the other end of the phone was named Michelle. And I told Michelle that I
was a kid and did not need an exercise machine, but I hoped she was having a good night.
 That’s when Michelle hung up on me. And I didn’t mind a bit.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 March 7, 1992 Dear friend,
 Girls are weird, and I don’t mean that offensively. I just can’t put it any other way.
 I have now gone on another date with Mary Elizabeth. In a lot of ways, it was similar to the
dance except that we got to wear more comfortable clothes. She was the one who asked me out
again, and I suppose that’s okay, but I think I’m going to start doing the asking from time to time
because I can’t always hope to get asked. Also, if I do the asking, then I’ll be sure to go out with
70
the girl of my choice if she says yes. It’s just so complicated.
 The good news is that I got to be the one who drove this time. I asked my father if I could
borrow his car. It happened at the dinner table.
 “What for?” My dad gets protective of his car.
 “Charlie’s got a girlfr,” my sister said.
 “She’s not my girlfr,” I said.
 “Who is this girl?” my father asked.
 “What’s going on?” my mother asked from the kitchen.
 “Charlie wants to borrow the car,” my dad replied.
 “What for?” my mother asked.
 “That’s what I’m trying to find out!” my father said with a raised voice.
 “No need to get snippy,” my mother said.
 “Sorry,” my father said without meaning it. Then, he turned back to me.
 “So, tell me about this girl.”
 So, I told him a little about Mary Elizabeth, leaving out the part about the tattoo and belly button
ring. He kind of smiled for a little while, trying to see if I was already guilty of something.
Then, he said yes. I could borrow his car. When my mother came in with coffee, my father told
her the whole story while I ate dessert.
 That night, as I was finishing my book, my father came in and sat on the edge of my bed. He
lit a cigarette and started telling me about sex. He gave me this talk a few years before, but it was
more biological then. Now, he was saying things like ...
 “I know I’m your old man, but ...”
 “you can’t be too careful these days,” and
 “wear protection,” and
 “if she says no, then you have to assume she means it ...”
 “because if you force her to do something she doesn’t want to do, then you’re in big trouble,
mister ...”
 “and even if she says no, and really means yes, then quite frankly she’s playing games and isn’t
worth the price of dinner.”
 “if you need to talk to somebody, you can come to me, but if you don’t want to do that for
some reason, talk to your brother,” and finally
 “I’m glad we had this talk.”
 Then, my father ruffled my hair, smiled, and left the room. I guess I should tell you that my
father isn’t like on television. Things like sex don’t embarrass him. And he is actually very smart
about them.
 I think he was especially happy because I used to kiss this boy in the neighborhood a lot when
71
I was very little, and even though the psychiatrist said it was very natural for little boys and girls to
explore things like that, I think my father was afraid anyway. I guess that’s natural, but I’m not sure
why.
 Anyway, Mary Elizabeth and I went to see a movie downtown. It was what they call an “art”
movie. Mary Elizabeth said it won an award at some big film festival in Europe, and she thought
that was impressive. As we waited for the movie to start, she said what a shame it was that so many
people would go to see a stupid Hollywood movie, but there were only a few people in this theater.
Then, she talked about how she couldn’t wait to get out of here and go to college where people appreciate
things like that.
 Then the movie started. It was in a foreign language and had subtitles, which was fun because I
had never read a movie before. The movie itself was very interesting, but I didn’t think it was very
good because I didn’t really feel different when it was over.
 But Mary Elizabeth felt different. She kept saying it was an “articulate” film. So “articulate.”
And I guess it was. The thing is, I didn’t know what it said even if it said it very well.
 Later, I drove us to this underground record store, and Mary Elizabeth gave me a tour. She
loves this record store. She said it was the one place where she felt like herself. She said that before
coffee shops were popular, there was nowhere for kids like her to go, except the Big Boy, and
that was old until this year.
 She showed me the movie section and told me about all these cult filmmakers and people from
France. Then, she took me down to the import section and told me about “real” alternative music.
Then, she took me to the folk section and told me about girl bands like the Slits.
 She said she felt really bad she hadn’t gotten me anything for Christmas, and she wanted to
make it up to me. Then, she bought me a record by Billie Holiday and asked if I wanted to go to
her house and listen to it.
 So, I was sitting alone in her basement while she was upstairs getting us something to drink.
And I looked around the room, which was very clean and smelled like people didn’t live there. It
had a fireplace with a mantel and golf trophies. And there was a television and a nice stereo. And
then Mary Elizabeth came downstairs with two glasses and a bottle of brandy. She said that she
hated everything her parents loved, except for brandy.
 She asked me to pour the drinks while she made a fire. She was very excited, too, which was
strange because she’s never like that. She kept talking about how much she loves fires and how she
wanted to marry a man and live in Vermont someday, which was strange, too, because Mary Elizabeth
never talks about things like that. When she finished the fire, she put on the record, and kind
of danced over to me. She said she felt very warm, but not in the temperature sense.
 The music started, and she clinked my glass, said “cheers,” and took a sip of brandy. Brandy is
very good, by the way, but it was better at the Secret Santa party. We finished the first glasses very
quickly.
 My heart was beating really fast, and I was starting to get nervous. She handed me another glass
of brandy and touched my hand very softly when she did it. Then, she slipped her leg over mine,
and I watched it just dangle there. Then, I felt her hand on the back of my neck. Just kind of
72
moving slowly. And my heart started beating crazy.
 “Do you like the record?” she asked real quiet.
 “Very much.” I really did, too. It was beautiful.
 “Charlie?”
 “Uh-huh?”
 “Do you like me?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “You know what I mean?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Are you nervous?”
 “Uh-huh.”
 “Don’t be nervous.”
 “Okay.”
 That’s when I felt her other hand. It started at my knee and worked its way up the side of my
leg to my hip and stomach. Then, she took her leg off mine and kind of sat on my lap facing me.
She looked right into my eyes, and she never blinked. Not once. Her face looked warm and different.
And she leaned down and started kissing my neck and ears. Then my cheeks. Then my lips.
And everything kind of melted away. She took my hand and slid it up her sweater, and I couldn’t
believe what was happening to me. Or what breasts felt like. Or later, what they looked like. Or
how difficult bras are.
 After we had done everything you can do from the stomach up, I lay down on the floor, and
Mary Elizabeth put her head on my chest. We both breathed very slowly and listened to the music
and the fire crack. When the last song was over, I felt her breath on my chest.
 “Charlie?”
 “Uh-huh?”
 “Do you think I’m pretty?”
 “I think you’re very pretty.”
 “Really?”
 “Really.”
 Then, she held on to me a little tighter, and for the next half hour, Mary Elizabeth didn’t talk at
all. All I could do was lie there and think about how much her voice changed when she asked me
if she was pretty, and how much she changed when I answered, and how Sam said she didn’t like
things like that, and how much my arm was beginning to hurt.
 Thank God we heard the automatic garage door opener when we did.
 Love always,
 Charlie

 March 28, 1996 Dear friend,
 It’s finally starting to get a little warm here, and the people are being nicer in the hallways. Not
to me necessarily, just in a general way. I wrote a paper about Walden for Bill, but this time I did
it differently. I didn’t write a book report. I wrote a report pretending that I was by myself near
a lake for two years. I pretended that I lived off the land and had insights. To tell you the truth, I
kind of like the idea of doing that right now.
 Ever since that night with Mary Elizabeth, everything has been different. It started out that
Monday in school where Sam and Patrick looked at me with big grins. Mary Elizabeth had told
them about the night we spent together, which I really didn’t want her to do, but Sam and Patrick
thought it was great, and they were really happy for both of us. Sam kept saying,
 “I can’t believe I didn’t think of it before. You guys are great together.”
 I think Mary Elizabeth thinks so, too, because she’s been acting completely different. She’s
nice all the time, but it doesn’t feel right. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s like we’ll be having
a cigarette outside with Sam and Patrick at the end of the day, and we’ll all be talking about something
until it’s time to go home. Then, when I get home, Mary Elizabeth will call me right away
and ask me, “What’s up?” And I don’t know what to say because the only thing new in my life is my
walk home, which isn’t a lot. But I describe the walk anyway. And then she starts talking, and she
doesn’t stop for a long time. She’s been doing this all week. That and picking lint off my clothes.
 At one point two days ago, she was talking about books, and she included a lot of books I had
read. And when I told her that I had read them, she asked me very long questions that were really
just her ideas with a question mark put at the end. The only thing I could say was either “yes” or
“no.” There was honestly no room to say anything else. After that, she started talking about her
plans for college, which I had heard before, so I put down the phone, went to the bathroom, and
when I came back, she was still talking. I know that was the wrong thing to do, but I thought if I
didn’t take a break, I would do something even worse. Like yell or hang up the phone.
 She also keeps talking about the Billie Holiday record she bought for me. And she says she
wants to expose me to all these great things. And to tell you the truth, I don’t really want to be
exposed to all these great things if it means that I’ll have to hear Mary Elizabeth talk about all the
great things she exposed me to all the time. It almost feels like of the three things involved: Mary
Elizabeth, me, and the great things, only the first one matters to Mary Elizabeth. I don’t understand
that. I would give someone a record so they could love the record, not so they would always
know that I gave it to them.
 Then, there was the dinner. Since the holidays were over, my mom asked if I would like to have
Sam and Patrick over for dinner like she promised after I told her they said she had great taste in
clothing. I was so excited! I told Patrick and Sam, and we made plans for a Sunday night, and about
two hours later, Mary Elizabeth walked up to me in the hall, and said,
 “What time Sunday?”
 I didn’t know what to do. It was just for Sam and Patrick. That was the whole idea from the
74
beginning. And I never even invited Mary Elizabeth. I guess I know why she assumed that she
would be invited, but she never even waited to see. Or even drop a hint. Or anything.
 So, at the dinner, the dinner where I wanted my mom and dad to see how nice and great Sam
and Patrick were, Mary Elizabeth talked the whole time. It wasn’t all her fault. My dad and mom
asked her more questions than they asked Sam or Patrick. I guess because I am going on dates with
Mary Elizabeth, and that is more curious to them than my friends are. I guess that makes sense.
But still. It’s like they never got to meet Sam and Patrick. And that was the whole point. By the
time dinner was over, and they all left, all my mom said was that Mary Elizabeth was smart, and all
my dad said was my “girlfr” was pretty. They didn’t say anything about Sam or Patrick. And all I
wanted from the whole night was for them to know my friends. That was very important to me.
 Sex things are weird, too. It’s like after that first night, we have this pattern where we basically
do what we did that first time, but there is no fire or Billie Holiday record because we are in a car,
and everything is rushed. Maybe this is the way things are supposed to be, but it doesn’t feel right.
 My sister has been reading all these books about women ever since she told her ex-boyfriend
that the pregnancy was a false alarm, and he wanted to get back together, and she said no.
 So, I asked her about Mary Elizabeth (leaving out the sex part) because I knew she could be
neutral about it, especially since she “stayed clear” of the dinner. My sister said Mary Elizabeth is
suffering from low self-esteem, but I told her that she said the same thing about Sam back in November
when she started dating Craig, and Sam is completely different. Everything can’t be low
self-esteem, can it?
 My sister tried to clarify things. She said that by introducing me to all these great things, Mary
Elizabeth gained a “superior position” that she wouldn’t need if she was confident about herself.
She also said that people who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don’t, nothing
will work out the way they want.
 I don’t know if this is right or not, but it made me sad regardless. Not for Mary Elizabeth. Or
for me. Just in general. Because I started to think that I didn’t know who Mary Elizabeth was at
all. I’m not saying she was lying to me, but she just acted so different before I got to know her, and
if she really isn’t like what she was at the beginning, I wish she could have just said so. But maybe
she is like she was at the beginning, and I just didn’t realize it. I just don’t want to be another thing
Mary Elizabeth is in charge of.
 I asked my sister what I should do, and she said the best thing to do is be honest about my feelings.
My psychiatrist said the same thing. And then I felt really sad because I thought maybe I was
different from how Mary Elizabeth originally saw me, too. And maybe I was lying by not telling
her that it was hard to listen to her all the time without getting to say anything back. But I was just
trying to be nice like Sam said I should. I don’t know where I went wrong.
 I tried to call my brother about this, but his roommate said he was really busy with school, so
I decided not to leave a message because I didn’t want to distract him. The one thing I did was
mail my report about Walden to him, so he could share it with his girlfr. Then, maybe if they had
time, they could read it, and we could talk about it, and I would have the chance to ask them both
what to do about Mary Elizabeth since they were going out in a good way and would know how
75
to make things work. Even if we didn’t get to talk about it, I would still love to meet my brother’s
girlfr. Even on the phone. I did get to see her once on a VCR tape of one of my brother’s football
games, but it’s really not the same thing. Even though she was very beautiful. But not in an
unconventional way. I don’t know why I’m saying all this. I just wish Mary Elizabeth would ask me
questions other than “What’s up?”
 Love always,
 Charlie
 April 18, 1992 Dear friend,
 I have made a terrible mess of things. I really have. I feel terrible about it. Patrick said the best
thing I could do is just stay away for a while.
 It all started last Monday. Mary Elizabeth came to school with a book of poems by a famous
poet named every. every. cummings. The story behind the book was that she saw a movie that
talked about one poem that compares this woman’s hands to flowers and rain. She thought it was
so beautiful that she went out and bought the book. She has read it a lot of times since, and she
said she wanted me to have my own copy. Not the copy she bought, but a new one.
 All day she told me to show everyone the book.
 I know I should have been grateful because it was a very nice thing to do. But I wasn’t grateful.
I wasn’t grateful at all. Don’t get me wrong. I acted like I was. But I wasn’t. To tell you the truth,
I was starting to get mad. Maybe if she would have given me the copy of the book that she bought
for herself, it would have been different. Or maybe if she had just hand-copied the rain poem she
loves on a piece of nice paper. And definitely if she didn’t make me show the book to everyone we
know.
 Maybe I should have been honest then, but it didn’t feel like the right time.
 When I left school that day, I didn’t go home because I just couldn’t talk to her on the phone,
and my mother is not a very “adroit” liar about things like that. So, instead, I walked to the area
where all the shops and video stores are. I went straight to the bookstore. And when the lady behind
the counter asked me if I needed any help, I opened up my bag, and I returned the book Mary
Elizabeth bought me. I didn’t do anything with the money. It just sat in my pocket.
 When I walked home, all I could think was what a terrible thing it was that I just did, and I
started crying. By the time I walked in the front door, I was crying so much that my sister stopped
watching television to talk to me. When I told her what I did, she drove me back to the bookstore
because I was too messy to drive, and I got the book back, which made me feel a little better.
 When Mary Elizabeth asked me where I had been all day on the phone that night, I told her that
I went to the store with my sister. And when she asked if I bought her something nice, I said I did.
I didn’t even think she was serious, but I said it anyway. I just felt so bad about almost returning
her book. I spent the next hour on the phone listening to her talk about the book. Then, we said
good night. Then, I went downstairs to ask my sister if she could drive me to the store again, so I
76
could get Mary Elizabeth something nice. My sister told me to drive myself. And that I had better
start being honest with Mary Elizabeth about how I feel. Maybe I should have then, but it just
didn’t feel like the right time.
 The next day in school I gave Mary Elizabeth the gift that I drove to buy her. It was a new copy
of To Kill a Mockingbird. The first thing Mary Elizabeth said was,
 “That’s original.”
 I just reminded myself that she didn’t say it mean. She wasn’t making fun of me. She wasn’t
comparing. Or criticizing. And she really wasn’t. Believe me. So, I just explained to her how Bill
gives me special books to read outside of class and how To Kill a Mockingbird was the first one.
And how it was special to me. Then, she said,
 “Thank you. It’s very sweet.”
 But then she went on to explain how she had read it three years earlier and thought it was
“overrated” and how they turned it into a black-and-white film with famous actors like Gregory
Peck and Robert Duvall that won an Academy Award for the screenplay writer. I just kind of put
my feelings away somewhere after that.
 I left school, walked around, and didn’t get home until one o’clock in the morning. When I explained
to my father why, he told me to act like a man.
 The next day in school, when Mary Elizabeth asked where I had been the day before, I told her
that I bought a pack of cigarettes, went to the Big Boy, and spent the entire day reading the every.
every. cummings book and eating club sandwiches. I knew I was safe saying that because she
would never ask me any questions about the book. And I was right. After she got done talking
about it that time, I didn’t think I’d ever really need to read it myself. Even if I wanted to.
 I definitely think I should have been honest then, but to tell you the truth, I was getting as mad
as I used to get playing sports, and it was starting to scare me.
 Luckily, Easter vacation was starting on Friday, and it distracted things a little bit. Bill gave me
Hamlet to read for the break. He said I would need the free time to really concentrate on the play.
I guess I don’t need to say who wrote it. The only advice Bill gave me was to think about the main
character in terms of the other main characters in the books I’ve read thus far. He said not to get
caught up thinking the play was “too fancy.”
 So, on Good Friday yesterday, we had a special showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
What made it special was the fact that everyone knew it was the beginning of Easter vacation, and
a lot of kids were still wearing their suits and dresses from Mass. It reminded me of Ash Wednesday
in school when the kids come in with thumbprints on their foreheads. It always adds an air of
excitement.
 After the show, Craig invited all of us back to his apartment to drink wine and listen to the
White Album. After the record was over, Patrick suggested we all play truth or dare, a game that he
loves to play when he’s “buzzed.”
 Guess who chose dares over truth all night? Me. I just didn’t want to tell Mary Elizabeth the
truth because of a game.
77
 It was working pretty well most of the night. The dares were things like “chug a beer.” But
then, Patrick gave me a dare. I don’t even think he knew what he was doing, but he gave it to me
anyway.
 “Kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips.”
 That’s when I chose to be honest. In retrospect, I probably could not have picked a worse time.
 The silence started after I stood up (since Mary Elizabeth was sitting right next to me). By the
time I had knelt down in front of Sam and kissed her, the silence was unbearable. It wasn’t a romantic
kiss. It was friendly, like when I played Rocky and she played Janet. But it didn’t matter.
 I could say that it was the wine or the beer that I chugged. I could also say that I had forgotten
the time Mary Elizabeth asked me if I thought she was pretty. But I would be lying. The truth is
that when Patrick dared me, I knew that if I kissed Mary Elizabeth, I would be lying to everyone.
Including Sam. Including Patrick. Including Mary Elizabeth. And I just couldn’t do it anymore.
Even if it was part of a game.
 After the silence, Patrick did his best to salvage the evening. The first thing he said was,
 “Well, isn’t this awkward?”
 But it didn’t work. Mary Elizabeth walked quickly out of the room and into the bathroom.
Patrick told me later that she didn’t want anyone to see her cry. Sam followed her, but before she
completely left the room, she turned to me and said serious and dark,
 “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
 It was the look on her face when she said it. And how much she meant it. It suddenly made
everything seem like it really was. I felt terrible. Just terrible. Patrick immediately stood up and
took me out of Craig’s apartment. We walked to the street, and the only thing I was aware of was
the cold. I said that I should go back inside and apologize. Patrick said,
 “No. I’ll get our coats. Just stay here.”
 When Patrick left me outside, I started to cry. It was real and panicky, and I couldn’t stop it.
When Patrick came back, I said, really crying,
 “I really think I should go apologize.”
 Patrick shook his head. “Believe me. You don’t want to go in there.”
 Then, he jiggled the car keys in front of my face and said, “Come on. I’ll take you home.”
 In the car, I told Patrick everything that had been going on. About the record. And the book.
And To Kill a Mockingbird. And how Mary Elizabeth never asked any questions. And all Patrick
said was, “It’s too bad you’re not gay.”
 That made me stop crying a little bit.
 “Then again, if you were gay, I would never date you. You’re a mess.”
 That made me start laughing a little bit.
 “And I thought Brad was fucked-up. Jesus.”
 That made me laugh a lot more. Then, he turned on the radio and we drove through the tun-
78
nels back home. When he dropped me off, Patrick told me the best thing to do was keep away for
a while. I guess I already told you that. He said that when he knew more, he’d give me a call.
 “Thanks, Patrick.”
 “Don’t mention it.”
 And then I said, “You know, Patrick? If I were gay, I’d want to date you.”
 I don’t know why I said it, but it seemed right.
 Patrick just smiled cocky and said, “Of course.” Then, he peeled out down the road.
 When I lay down in bed that night, I put on the Billie Holiday record, and I started reading the
book of every. every. cummings poems. After I read the poem that compares the woman’s hands
to flowers and rain, I put the book down and went to the window. I stared at my reflection and
the trees behind it for a long time. Not thinking anything. Not feeling anything. Not hearing the
record. For hours.
 Something really is wrong with me. And I don’t know what it is.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 April 26, 1992 Dear friend,
 Nobody has called me since that night. I don’t blame them. I have spent the whole vacation
reading Hamlet. Bill was right. It was much easier to think of the kid in the play like the other
characters I’ve read about so far. It has also helped me while I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong
with me. It didn’t give me any answers necessarily, but it was helpful to know that someone else
has been through it. Especially someone who lived such a long time ago.
 I did call Mary Elizabeth, and I told her that I’d been listening to the record every night and
reading the every. every. cummings book.
 She just said, “It’s too late, Charlie.”
 I would have explained that I didn’t want to start going on dates again and I was just doing these
things as a friend, but I knew it would have only made things worse, so I didn’t.
 I just said, “I’m sorry.”
 And I really was sorry. And I know that she believed me. But when that didn’t make any difference,
and there was nothing but a bad silence on the phone, I really knew it was too late.
 Patrick did call me, but all he said was that Craig got really angry at Sam about me, and I should
keep staying away until things got clear. I asked him if he would like to go out, just him and me.
He said that he would be busy with Brad and family things, but he’d try to call me if he could find
the time. So far, he hasn’t.
 I would tell you about Easter Sunday with my family, but I’ve already told you about Thanksgiving
and Christmas, and there really isn’t much of a difference.
79
 Except that my father got a raise, and my mother didn’t because she doesn’t get paid for housework,
and my sister stopped reading those self-esteem books because she met a new boy.
 My brother did come home, but when I asked him if his girlfr read my report on Walden, he
said no because she broke up with him when she found out he was cheating on her. That happened
a while ago. So, I asked him if he had read it himself, and he said that he hadn’t because he
was too busy. He said he would try to read it over vacation. So far, he hasn’t.
 So, I went to visit my aunt Helen, and for the first time in my life, it didn’t help. I even tried to
follow my own plan and remember all the details about the last time I had a great week, but that
didn’t help, either.
 I know that I brought this all on myself. I know that I deserve this. I’d do anything not to be
this way. I’d do anything to make it up to everyone. And to not have to see a psychiatrist, who
explains to me about being “passive aggressive.” And to not have to take the medicine he gives me,
which is too expensive for my dad. And to not have to talk about bad memories with him. Or be
nostalgic about bad things.
 I just wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what’s
wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go
away. And disappear. I know that’s wrong because it’s my responsibility, and I know that things get
worse before they get better because that’s what my psychiatrist says, but this is a worse that feels
too big.
 After a week of not talking to anyone, I finally called Bob. I know that’s wrong, but I didn’t
know what else to do. I asked him if he had anything I could buy. He said he had a quarter ounce
of pot left. So, I took some of my Easter money and bought it.
 I’ve been smoking it all the time since.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 Part 4
 April 29, 1992 Dear friend,
 I wish I could report that it’s getting better, but unfortunately it isn’t. It’s hard, too, because
we’ve started school again, and I can’t go to the places where I used to go. And it can’t be like it
was. And I wasn’t ready to say good-bye just yet.
 To tell you the truth, I’ve just been avoiding everything.
 I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder
why they’re here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they
were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It’s like looking at all the students and wondering
who’s had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes
and a book report on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.
80
Especially since I know that if they went to another school, the person who had their heart broken
would have had their heart broken by somebody else, so why does it have to be so personal? And if
I went to another school, I would never have known Sam or Patrick or Mary Elizabeth or anyone
except my family.
 I can tell you one thing that happened. I was in the shopping mall because that’s where I go
lately. For the last couple of weeks, I’ve been going there every day, trying to figure out why people
go there. It’s kind of a personal project.
 There was this one little boy. He might have been four years old. I’m not sure. He was crying
really hard, and he kept screaming for his mom. He must have been lost. Then, I saw this older
kid, who was maybe seventeen. I think he went to a different school because I had never seen him
before. Anyway, this older kid, who was really tough-looking with a leather jacket and long hair and
everything, went up to the little boy and asked him what his name was. The little boy answered and
stopped crying.
 Then, the older kid walked away with the little boy.
 A minute later, I heard the intercom say to the mom that her boy was at the information desk.
So, I went to the information desk to see what would happen.
 I guess the mom had been searching for the little boy for a long time because she came running
up to the information desk, and when she saw the little boy, she started crying. She held him tightly
and told him to never run off again. Then, she thanked the older kid who had helped, and all the
older kid said was, “Next time just watch him a little fucking better.”
 Then, he walked away.
 The man with the moustache behind the information desk was speechless. So was the mom.
The little boy just wiped his nose, looked up at his mom, and said,
 “French fries.”
 The mom looked down at the little boy and nodded, and they left. So, I followed them. They
went to the place where the food stands are, and they got french fries. The little boy was smiling
and getting ketchup all over himself. And the mom kept wiping his face in between taking drags
off her cigarette.
 I kept looking at the mom, trying to imagine what she must have looked like when she was
young. If she was married. If her little boy was an accident or planned. And if that made a difference.
 I saw other people there. Old men sitting alone. Young girls with blue eye shadow and awkward
jaws. Little kids who looked tired. Fathers in nice coats who looked even more tired. Kids
working behind the counters of the food places who looked like they hadn’t had the will to live for
hours. The machines kept opening and closing. The people kept giving money and getting their
change. And it all felt very unsettling to me.
 So, I decided to find another place to go and figure out why people go there. Unfortunately,
there aren’t a lot of places like that. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going without a
friend. I used to be able to do it very easily, but that was before I knew what having a friend was
81
like. It’s much easier not to know things sometimes. And to have french fries with your mom be
enough.
 The only person I’ve really talked to in the last two weeks was Susan, the girl who used to “go
with” Michael back in middle school when she had braces. I saw her standing in the hall, surrounded
by a group of boys I didn’t know. They were all laughing and making sex jokes, and Susan was
doing her best to laugh along with them. When she saw me approaching the group, her face went
“ashen.” It was almost like she didn’t want to remember what she was like twelve months ago, and
she certainly didn’t want the boys to know that she knew me and used to be my friend. The whole
group got quiet and stared at me, but I didn’t even notice them. I just looked at Susan, and all I
said was,
 “Do you ever miss him?”
 I didn’t say it mean or accusingly. I just wanted to know if anybody else remembered Michael.
To tell you the truth, I was stoned in a bad way, and I couldn’t get the question out of my mind.
 Susan was at a loss. She didn’t know what to do. These were the first words we had spoken
since the end of last year. I guess it wasn’t fair of me to ask her in a group like that, but I never see
her by herself anymore, and I really needed to know.
 At first, I thought her blank expression was the result of surprise, but after it didn’t go away for
a long while, I knew that it wasn’t. It suddenly dawned on me that if Michael were still around, Susan
probably wouldn’t be “going out” with him anymore. Not because she’s a bad person or shallow
or mean. But because things change. And friends leave. And life doesn’t stop for anybody.
 “I’m sorry I bothered you, Susan. I’m just having a tough time. That’s all. Have a good one,” I
said and walked away.
 “God, that kid is such a fucking freak,” I heard one of the boys whisper when I was halfway
down the hall. He said it more factual than mean, and Susan didn’t correct him. I don’t know if I
would have corrected him myself these days.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 May 2, 1992 Dear friend,
 A few days ago, I went to see Bob to buy more pot. I should probably say that I keep forgetting
Bob doesn’t go to school with us. Probably because he watches more television than anyone
I know, and he’s great with trivia. You should see him talk about Mary Tyler Moore. It’s kind of
spooky.
 Bob has this very specific way of living. He says he takes a shower every other day. He weighs
his “stash” daily. He says when you’re smoking a cigarette with someone, and you have a lighter,
you should light their cigarette first. But if you have matches, you should light your cigarette first,
so you breathe in the “harmful sulfur” instead of them. He says it’s the polite thing to do. He also
says that it’s bad luck to have “three on a match.” He heard that from his uncle who fought in Viet-
82
nam. Something about how three cigarettes was enough time for the enemy to know where you
are.
 Bob says that when you’re alone, and you light a cigarette, and the cigarette is only halfway
lit that means someone is thinking about you. He also says that when you find a penny, it’s only
“lucky” if it’s heads-up. He says the best thing to do is find a lucky penny when you’re with someone
and give the other person the good luck. He believes in karma. He also loves to play cards.
 Bob goes part-time to the local community college. He wants to be a chef. He is an only child,
and his parents are never home. He says it used to bother him a lot when he was younger, but not
so much anymore.
 The thing about Bob is that when you first meet him, he’s really interesting because he knows
about cigarette rules and pennies and Mary Tyler Moore. But after you’ve known him for a while,
he starts to repeat these things. In the last few weeks, he hasn’t said anything that I haven’t heard
from him before. That’s what made it such a shock when he told me what happened.
 Basically, Brad’s father caught Brad and Patrick together.
 I guess that Brad’s father didn’t know about his son because when he caught them, Brad’s father
started beating Brad. Not a slap kind of beating. A belt kind. A real kind. Patrick told Sam who
told Bob that he had never seen anything like it. I guess it was that bad. He wanted to say “Stop”
and “You’re killing him.” He even wanted to hold Brad’s father down. But he just froze. And Brad
kept yelling, “Get out!” to Patrick. And finally, Patrick just did.
 That was last week. And Brad still hasn’t come to school. Everyone thinks he might have been
sent to a military school or something. Nobody knows for sure about anything. Patrick tried calling
once, but when Brad’s father answered, he just hung up.
 Bob said Patrick was “in bad shape.” I can’t tell you how sad I felt when he told me that because
I wanted to call Patrick and be his friend and help him. But I didn’t know if I should call him because
of what he had said about waiting until things got clear. The thing was I couldn’t think about
anything else.
 So, on Friday, I went to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I waited until the movie had already
started before I went into the theater. I didn’t want to ruin the show for everybody. I just wanted
to see Patrick play Frank ‘n Furter just like he always does because I knew that if I saw that, I knew
he would be okay. Just like my sister getting mad at me for smoking cigarettes.
 I sat in the back row and looked on the stage. It was still a couple of scenes before Frank ‘n
Furter enters. That’s when I saw Sam playing Janet. And I missed her so much. And I was so
sorry about how I messed everything up. Especially when I saw Mary Elizabeth playing Magenta.
It was all very hard to watch. But then Patrick finally came on as Frank ‘n Furter, and he was great.
He was actually better than ever in a lot of ways. It was just so nice to see all my friends. I left
before the movie was over.
 I drove home listening to some of the songs we listened to those times when we were infinite.
And I pretended they were in the car with me. I even talked out loud. I told Patrick how I thought
he was great. I asked Sam about Craig. I told Mary Elizabeth that I was sorry and how much I really
loved the every. every. cummings book and wanted to ask her questions about it. But then I
83
stopped because it started to make me too sad. I also thought that if anybody saw me talking out
loud when I was alone in the car, their looks might convince me that the something that’s wrong
with me might be even worse than I thought.
 When I got home, my sister was watching a movie with her new boyfriend. There isn’t much to
say other than his name is Erik, and he has short hair and is a junior. Erik had rented the movie.
After I shook hands with him, I asked them about the movie because I didn’t recognize it except
for an actor who used to be on a TV show, and I couldn’t remember his name.
 My sister said, “It’s stupid. You wouldn’t like it.”
 I said, “What’s it about?”
 She said, “Come on, Charlie. It’s almost over.”
 I said, “Would it be okay if I watched the end?”
 She said, “You can watch it when we’re done.”
 I said, “Well, how about I watch the end with you, and then I can rewind it and watch up to the
point I started watching with you?”
 That’s when she paused the movie.
 “Can’t you take a hint?”
 “I suppose not.”
 “We want to be alone, Charlie.”
 “Oh. I’m sorry.”
 To tell you the truth, I knew she wanted to be alone with Erik, but I really wanted to have some
company. I knew it wasn’t fair, though, to ruin her time just because I miss everybody, so I just said
good night and left.
 I went up to my room and started reading the new book Bill gave me. It’s called The Stranger.
Bill said that it’s “very easy to read, but very hard to `read well.’” I have no idea what he means, but
I like the book so far.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 May 8, 1992 Dear friend,
 It’s strange how things can change back as suddenly as they changed originally. When one thing
happens and suddenly, things are back to normal.
 On Monday, Brad came back to school.
 He looked very different. It wasn’t that he was bruised or anything. His face actually looked
fine. But before, Brad was always this guy who walked down the hallway with a bounce. I can’t
really describe it any other way. It’s just that some people walk with their heads to the ground for
84
some reason. They don’t like to look other people in the eye. Brad was never like that. But now
he is. Especially when it comes to Patrick.
 I saw them talking quiet in the hallway. I was too far away to hear what they said, but I could
tell that Brad was ignoring Patrick. And when Patrick started to get upset, Brad just closed his
locker and walked away. It wasn’t that strange because Brad and Patrick never talked in school since
Brad wanted things to be secret. The strange part was that Patrick would walk up to Brad in the
first place. So, I guessed that they didn’t meet on the golf courses anymore. Or talk on the phone
even.
 Later that afternoon, I was having a cigarette outside by myself, and I saw Patrick alone, also
having a cigarette. I wasn’t close enough to really see him, but I didn’t want to interfere with his
personal time, so I didn’t walk up to him. But Patrick was crying. He was crying pretty hard. After
that, whenever I saw him around anywhere, he didn’t look like he was there. He looked like he was
someplace else. And I think I knew that because that’s how people used to say I was. Maybe they
still do. I’m not sure.
 On Thursday, something really terrible happened.
 I was sitting alone in the cafeteria, eating salisbury steak, when I saw Patrick walk up to Brad,
who was sitting with his football buddies, and I saw Brad ignore him like he did at the locker. And
I saw Patrick get really upset, but Brad still ignored him. Then, I saw Patrick say something, and he
looked pretty angry as he turned to walk away. Brad sat still for a second, then he turned around.
And then I heard it. It was just loud enough for a few tables to hear. The thing that Brad yelled at
Patrick.
 “Faggot!”
 Brad’s football buddies start laughing. A few tables got quiet as Patrick turned around. He was
mad as hell. I’m not kidding. He stormed up to Brad’s table and said,
 “What did you call me?”
 God, he was mad. I’d never seen Patrick like that before.
 Brad sat quiet for a second, but his buddies kept egging him on by pushing his shoulders. Brad
looked up at Patrick and said softer and meaner than the last time,
 “I called you a faggot.”
 Brad’s buddies started laughing even harder. That is, until Patrick threw the first punch. It’s
kind of eerie when a whole room gets quiet at once, and then the real noise starts.
 The fight was hard. A lot harder than the one I had with Sean last year. There was no clean
punching or things you see in movies. They just wrestled and hit. And whoever was the most aggressive
or the most angry got in the most hits. In this case, it was pretty even until Brad’s buddies
got involved, and it became five on one.
 That’s when I got involved. I just couldn’t watch them hurt Patrick even if things weren’t clear
just yet.
 I think anyone who knew me might have been frightened or confused. Except maybe my
brother. He taught me what to do in these situations. I don’t really want to go into detail except to
85
say that by the end of it, Brad and two of his buddies stopped fighting and just stared at me. His
other two friends were lying on the ground. One was clutching the knee I bashed in with one of
those metal cafeteria chairs. The other one was holding his face. I kind of swiped at his eyes, but
not too bad. I didn’t want to be too bad.
 I looked down at the ground, and I saw Patrick. His face was pretty messed up, and he was
crying hard. I helped him to his feet, and then I looked at Brad. I don’t think we’d ever really exchanged
two words before, but I guess this was the time to start. All I said was,
 “If you ever do this again, I’ll tell everyone. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll blind you.”
 I pointed at his friend who was holding his face, and I knew Brad heard me and knew that I
meant it. He didn’t say anything back, though, because the security guards of our school came to
bring all of us out of the cafeteria. They took us first to the nurse, and then to Mr. Small. Patrick
started the fight, so he was suspended for a week. Brad’s buddies got three days each for ganging
up on Patrick after they broke up the original fight. Brad wasn’t suspended at all because it was selfdefense.
I didn’t get suspended either because I was just helping to defend a friend when it was five
on one.
 Brad and I got a month’s detention, starting that day.
 In detention, Mr. Harris didn’t set up any rules. He just let us read or do homework or talk. It
really isn’t much of a punishment unless you like the television programs right after school or are
very concerned with your permanent record. I wonder if it’s all a lie. A permanent record, I mean.
 On that first day of detention, Brad came to sit next to me. He looked very sad. I think it all
kind of hit him after he stopped feeling numb from the fight.
 “Charlie?”
 “Yeah?”
 “Thanks. Thanks for stopping them.”
 “You’re welcome.”
 And that was it. I haven’t said anything to him since. And he didn’t sit next to me today. At
first when he said it, I was kind of confused. But then I think I got it. Because I wouldn’t want a
bunch of my friends beating up Sam even if I wasn’t allowed to like her anymore either.
 When I got out of detention that day, Sam was waiting for me. The minute I saw her, she
smiled. I was numb. I just couldn’t believe she was really there. Then, I saw her turn and give
Brad a real cold look.
 Brad said, “Tell him I’m sorry.”
 Sam replied, “Tell him yourself.”
 Brad looked away and walked to his car. Then, Sam walked up to me and messed up my hair.
 “So, I heard you’re this ninja or something.”
 I think I nodded.
 Sam drove me home in her pickup truck. On the way, she told me that she was really angry at
86
me for doing what I did to Mary Elizabeth. She told me that Mary Elizabeth is a really old friend
of hers. She even reminded me that Mary Elizabeth was there for her when she went through that
tough time she told me about when she gave me the typewriter. I don’t really want to repeat what
that was.
 So, she said that when I kissed her instead of Mary Elizabeth, I really hurt their friendship for a
while. Because I guess Mary Elizabeth really liked me a lot. That made me feel sad because I didn’t
know that she liked me that much. I just thought she wanted to expose me to all those great things.
That’s when Sam said,
 “Charlie, you’re so stupid sometimes. Do you know that?”
 “Yeah. I really do. Know that. Honest.”
 Then, she said that Mary Elizabeth and she got over it, and she thanked me for taking Patrick’s
advice and staying away for as long as I did because it made things easier. So, then I said,
 “So, we can be friends now?”
 “Of course,” was all she said.
 “And Patrick?”
 “And Patrick.”
 “And everyone else?”
 “And everyone else.”
 That’s when I started crying. But Sam told me to shush.
 “You remember what I said to Brad?”
 “Yeah. You told him that he should tell Patrick that he was sorry himself.”
 “That goes for Mary Elizabeth, too.”
 “I tried, but she told me ...”
 “I know you tried. I’m telling you to try again.”
 “Okay.”
 Sam dropped me off. When she was too far away to see me, I started to cry again. Because she
was my friend again. And that was enough for me. So, I made myself promise to never mess up
like I did before. And I’m never going to. I can tell you that.
 When I went to The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight, it was very tense. Not because of
Mary Elizabeth. That was actually okay. I said I was sorry, and then I asked her if there was anything
she wanted to say to me. And like before, I asked a question and got a very long answer.
When I was done listening (I really did listen), I said I was sorry again. Then, she thanked me for
not trying to make what I did seem less by offering a lot of excuses. And things were back to normal
except we were just friends.
 To tell you the truth, I think the biggest reason for everything being okay is that Mary Elizabeth
started dating one of Craig’s friends. His name is Peter, and he’s in college, which makes Mary
Elizabeth happy. At the party at Craig’s apartment, I overheard Mary Elizabeth say to Alice that
87
she was much happier with Peter because he was “opinionated,” and they had debates. She said
that I was really sweet and understanding, but that our relationship was too one-sided. She wanted
a person who was more open to discussion and didn’t need someone’s permission to talk.
 I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everyone was, especially
me. But I was at a party with my friends, so it really didn’t matter that much. I just drank because I
figured that it was about time to stop smoking so much pot.
 The thing that made the evening tense was Patrick officially quit doing Frank ‘Not Furter in the
show. He said that he didn’t want to do it anymore ... ever. So, he sat and watched the show in the
audience with me, and he said things that were hard to listen to because Patrick usually isn’t unhappy.
 “You ever think, Charlie, that our group is the same as any other group like the football team?
And the only real difference between us is what we wear and why we wear it?”
 “Yeah?” And there was this pause.
 “Well, I think it’s all bullshit.”
 And he meant it. It was hard to see him mean it that much.
 Some guy that I didn’t know from somewhere else did the part of Frank ‘Not Furter. He had
been the second to Patrick for a long time, and now he got his chance. He was pretty good, too.
Not as good as Patrick, but pretty good.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 May 11, 1992 Dear friend,
 I’ve been spending a lot of time with Patrick these days. I really haven’t said much. I just kind
of listen and nod because Patrick needs to talk. But it isn’t like it was with Mary Elizabeth. It’s different.
 It started out on the Saturday morning after the show. I was in my bed trying to figure out
why sometimes you can wake up and go back to sleep and other times you can’t. Then, my mom
knocked.
 “Your friend Patrick’s on the phone.”
 So, I got up and wiped away the sleep.
 “Hello?”
 “Get dressed. I’m on my way.”
 Click. That was it. I actually had a lot of work to do since it was getting closer to the end of
the school year, but it sounded like we might be having some kind of adventure, so I got dressed
anyway.
 Patrick pulled up about ten minutes later. He was wearing the same clothes he wore the night
88
before. He hadn’t showered or anything. I don’t even think he went to bed. He was just wide
awake on coffee and cigarettes and Mini Thins, which are these small pills you can buy at Quick
Marts or Truck Stops. They keep you awake! They’re not illegal either, but they make you thirsty.
 So, I climbed in Patrick’s car, which was filled with cigarette smoke. He offered me one, but I
said not in front of my house.
 “Your parents don’t know you smoke?”
 “No. Should they?”
 “I guess not.”
 Then, we started driving ... fast.
 At first, Patrick didn’t say much. He just listened to the music on the tape player. After the second
song started, I asked him if it was the mix tape I made him for Secret Santa Christmas.
 “I’ve been listening to it all night.”
 Patrick had this smile all over his face. It was a sick smile. Glazey and numb. He just turned up
the volume. And drove faster.
 “I’ll tell you something, Charlie. I feel good. You know what I mean? Really good. Like I’m
free or something. Like I don’t have to pretend anymore. I’m going away to college, right? It’ll be
different there. You know what I mean?”
 “Sure,” I said.
 “I’ve been thinking all night about what kind of posters I want to put up in my dorm room.
And if I’ll have an exposed brick wall. I’ve always wanted an exposed brick wall, so I can paint it.
Know what I mean?”
 I just nodded this time because he didn’t really wait for a “sure.”
 “Things’ll be different there. They have to be.”
 “They will be,” I said.
 “You really think so?”
 “Sure.”
 “Thanks, Charlie.”
 That’s kind of how it went all day. We went to see a movie. And we ate pizza. And every time
Patrick started getting tired, we got coffee, and he ate another Mini Thin or two. When things
started turning dusk outside, he showed me all the places he and Brad would meet. He didn’t say
much about them. He just stared.
 We ended up at the golf course.
 We sat on the eighteenth green, which was pretty high on a hill, and we watched the sun disappear.
By this point, Patrick had bought a bottle of red wine with his fake ID, and we passed it back
and forth. Just talking.
 “Did you hear about Lily?” he asked.
89
 “Who?”
 “Lily Miller. I don’t know what her real first name was, but they called her Lily. She was a senior
when I was a sophomore.”
 “I don’t think so.”
 “I thought your brother would have told you. It’s a classic.”
 “Maybe.”
 “Okay. Stop me if you heard it.”
 “Okay.”
 “So, Lily comes up here with this guy who was the lead in all the plays.”
 “Parker?”
 “Right, Parker. How did you know?”
 “My sister had a crush on him.”
 “Perfect!” We were getting pretty drunk. “So, Parker and Lily come up here one night. And
they are so in love! He even gave her his thespian pin or something.”
 At this point, Patrick is spitting out wine between sentences, he’s laughing so hard.
 “They even had a song. Something like Broken Wings by that band, Mr. Mister. I don’t even
know, but I hope it was Broken Wings because it would make the story perfect.”
 “Keep going,” I encouraged.
 “Okay. Okay.” He swallowed. “So, they’ve been going out for a long time, and I think they’ve
even had sex before, but this was going to be a special night. She packed a little picnic, and he
brought a boom box to play Broken Wings.”
 Patrick just couldn’t get over that song. He laughed for ten minutes.
 “Okay. Okay. I’m sorry. So, they have this picnic with sandwiches and everything. They start
to make out. The stereo’s playing, and they’re just about to `do it’ when Parker realizes he forgot
the condoms. They’re both naked on this putting green. They both want each other. There’s no
condom. So, what do you think happened?”
 “I don’t know.”
 “They did it doggie-style with one of the sandwich bags!”
 “NO!” was all I could really say.
 “YES!” was Patrick’s rebuttal.
 “GOD!” was my counter.
 “YES!” was Patrick’s conclusion.
 After we shook off the giggles and wasted most of the wine with spit takes, he turned to me.
 “And you want to know the best part?”
 “What?”
90
 “She was the valedictorian. And everyone knew it when she went up to give her speech!”
 There’s nothing like the deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore
stomach for the right reasons. It was that great.
 So, Patrick and I shared all the stories we could think of.
 There was a kid named Barry, who used to build kites in art class. Then, after school, he would
attach firecrackers to the kite and fly it and blow it up. He’s now studying to be an air traffic controller.
 --Patrick’s story via Sam
 And then there was this kid named Chip who spent all of his money from allowance and Christmas
and birthdays to buy bug killing equipment and he would go door to door asking if he could
kill the bugs for free.
 --my story via my sister
 There was a guy named Carl Burns and everyone called him C.B. And one day C.B. got so
drunk at a party that he tried to “fuck” the host’s dog.
 --Patrick’s story
 And there was this guy they called “Action Jack” because supposedly he was caught masturbating
at a drunk party. And at every pep rally, the kids would clap and chant. Action Jack ... clap
clap clap ... Action Jack!
 --my story via my brother
 There were other stories and other names. Second Base Stace, who had breasts in the fourth
grade and let some of the boys feel them. Vincent, who took acid and tried to flush a sofa down
the toilet. Sheila, who allegedly masturbated with a hot dog and had to go to the emergency room.
The list went on and on.
 By the end, all I could think was what these people must feel like when they go to their class
reunions. I wonder if they’re embarrassed, and I wonder if that’s a small price to pay for being a
legend.
 After we sobered up a bit with coffee and Mini Thins, Patrick drove me home. The mix tape I
made for him hit a bunch of winter songs. And Patrick turned to me.
 “Thanks, Charlie.”
 “Sure.”
 “No. I mean in the cafeteria.”
 “Sure.”
 After that, it was quiet. He drove me home and pulled up in the driveway. We hugged good
night, and when I was just about to let go, he held me a little tighter. And he moved his face to
mine. And he kissed me. A real kiss. Then, he pulled away real slow.
 “I’m sorry.”
 “No. That’s okay.”
91
 “Really. I’m sorry.”
 “No, really. It was okay.”
 So, he said “thanks” and hugged me again. And moved in to kiss me again. And I just let him.
I don’t know why. We stayed in his car for a long time.
 We didn’t do anything other than kiss. And we didn’t even do that for very long. After a while,
his eyes lost the glazey numb look from the wine or the coffee or the fact that he had stayed up the
night before. Then, he started crying. Then, he started talking about Brad.
 And I just let him. Because that’s what friends are for.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 May 17, 1992 Dear friend,
 It seems like every morning since that first night, I wake up dull, and my head hurts, and I can’t
breathe. Patrick and I have been spending a lot of time together. We drink a lot. Actually, it’s more
like Patrick drinks, and I sip.
 It’s just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can’t do anything except “be
there.” I want to make him stop hurting, but I can’t. So, I just follow him around whenever he
wants to show me his world.
 One night Patrick took me to this park where men go to find each other. Patrick told me that
if I didn’t want to be bothered by anyone that I should just not make eye contact. He said that eye
contact is how you agree to fool around anonymously. Nobody talks. They just find places to go.
After a while, Patrick saw someone he liked. He asked me if I needed any cigarettes, and when I
said no, he patted my shoulder and walked away with this boy.
 I just sat on a bench, looking around. All I saw were the shadows of people. Some on the
ground. Some by a tree. Some just walking. It was so quiet. After a few minutes, I lit a cigarette,
and I heard somebody whisper.
 “You got an extra cigarette?” the voice asked.
 I turned around and saw a man in shadow.
 “Sure,” I said.
 I reached out to hand the man a cigarette. He took it.
 “You got a light?” he said.
 “Sure,” I said, and I struck a match for him.
 Instead of just leaning down and lighting the cigarette, he reached out to make a cup around the
match with our hands, which is something we all do when it’s windy. But it wasn’t windy. I think
he just wanted to touch my hands because while he was lighting the cigarette, he did it for a lot longer
than necessary. Maybe he wanted me to see his face over the glow of the match. To see how
92
handsome he was. I don’t know. He did look familiar. But I couldn’t figure out from where.
 He blew out the match. “Thanks.” And exhaled.
 “No problem,” I said.
 “Mind if I sit down?” he asked.
 “Not really.”
 He sat down. And said a few things. And it was his voice. I recognized his voice. So, I lit
another cigarette and looked at his face again, and thought hard, and that’s when I figured it out. It
was the guy who does the sports on the TV news!
 “Nice night,” he said.
 I couldn’t believe it! I guess I managed to nod because he kept talking. About sports! He kept
talking about how the designated hitter in baseball was bad and why basketball was a commercial
success and what teams looked promising in college football. He even mentioned my brother’s
name! I swear!
 All I said was, “So, what’s it like being on television?”
 It must have been the wrong thing to say because he just got up and walked away. It was too
bad because I wanted to ask him if he thought my brother would make it to the pros.
 Another night, Patrick took me to this place where they sell poppers, which is this drug you inhale.
They didn’t have poppers, but the guy behind the counter said that he had something that was
just as good. So, Patrick bought that. It was in this aerosal can. We both took a sniff of it, and I
swear we both thought we were going to die of a heart attack.
 All in all, I think Patrick took me to about every place there is to go that I wouldn’t have known
about otherwise. There was this karaoke bar on one of the main streets in the city. And there was
this dance club. And this one bathroom in this one gym. All these places. Sometimes, Patrick
would pick up guys. Sometimes, he wouldn’t. He said that it was hard being safe. And you never
know.
 The nights he would pick up someone always made him sad. It’s hard, too, because Patrick began
every night really excited. He always said he felt free. And tonight was his destiny. And things
like that. But by the end of that night, he just looked sad. Sometimes, he would talk about Brad.
Sometimes, he wouldn’t. But after a while, the whole thing just wasn’t interesting to him anymore,
and he ran out of things to keep himself numb.
 So, tonight, he dropped me off at home. It was the night we went back to the park where men
meet. And the night he saw Brad there with some guy. Brad was too into what he was doing to
notice us. Patrick didn’t say anything. He didn’t do anything. He just walked back to the car. And
we drove in silence. On the way, he threw the bottle of wine out the window. And it landed with a
crash. And this time he didn’t try to kiss me like he had every night. He just thanked me for being
his friend. And drove away.
 Love always,
 Charlie

 May 21, 1992 Dear friend,
 The school year is just about over. We have another month or so to go. But the seniors like my
sister and Sam and Patrick only have a couple of weeks. Then, they have prom and graduation, and
they are all busy making plans.
 Mary Elizabeth is taking her new boyfriend, Peter. My sister is taking Erik. Patrick is going with
Alice. And Craig agreed to go with Sam this time. They have even rented a limo and everything.
Not my sister, though. She’s going in her new boyfriend’s car, which is a Buick.
 Bill has been very sentimental lately because he can feel his first year of teaching coming to
an end. At least that’s what he said to me. He was planning on moving to New York and writing
plays, but he told me that he doesn’t really think he wants to anymore. He really likes teaching kids
English and thinks maybe he can take over the drama department, too, next year.
 I guess he’s been thinking about this a lot because he hadn’t given me a new book to read since
The Stranger.He did ask me to watch a lot of movies, though, and write an essay about what I
thought of all those movies. The movies were The Graduate, Harold and Maude, My Life as a
Dog (which has subtitles!), Dead Poets Society, and a movie called The Unbelievable Truth, which
was very hard to find.
 I watched all the movies in one day. It was quite great.
 The essay I wrote was very similar to the past few essays I wrote because everything Bill tells me
to read or see are similar. Except the time he had me read Naked Lunch.
 Incidentally, he told me he had given me that book because he had just broken up with his girlfr
and was feeling philosophical. I guess that’s why he was sad that afternoon when we talked about
On the Road. He apologized for letting his personal life affect his teaching, and I accepted because
I didn’t know what else to do. It’s strange to think about your teachers as being people even when
they’re Bill. I guess he has since made up with his girlfr. They’re living together now. At least that’s
what he said.
 So, in school Bill gave me my final book to read for the year. It’s called The Fountainhead, and
it’s very long.
 When he gave me the book, Bill said, “Be skeptical about this one. It’s a great book. But try to
be a filter, not a sponge.”
 Sometimes, I think Bill forgets that I am sixteen. But I am very happy that he does.
 I haven’t started reading it because I am very behind in my other classes because I spent so
much time with Patrick. But if I can catch up, I will end my first year with straight A’s, which makes
me very happy. I almost didn’t get an A in math, but then Mr. Carlo told me to stop asking “why?”
all the time and just follow the formulas. So, I did. Now, I get perfect scores on all my tests. I just
wish I knew what the formulas did. I honestly have no idea.
 I was just thinking that I wrote to you first because I was afraid about starting high school. Today,
I feel good, so that’s kind of funny.
94
 By the way, Patrick stopped drinking that night he saw Brad in the park. I guess he’s feeling better.
He just wants to graduate and go to college now.
 I saw Brad in detention the Monday after I saw him at the park. And he looked just like he
always looks.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 May 27, 1992 Dear friend,
 I’ve been reading The Fountainhead for the past few days, and it’s an excellent book. I read on
the back cover that the author was born in Russia and came to America when she was young. She
barely spoke English, but she wanted to be a great writer. I thought that was very admirable, so I
sat down and tried to write a story.
 “Ian MacArthur is a wonderful sweet fellow who wears glasses and peers out of them with delight.”
 That was the first sentence. The problem was that I just couldn’t think of the next one. After
cleaning my room three times, I decided to leave Ian alone for a while because I was starting to get
mad at him.
 I’ve had a lot of time to write and read and think about things this past week because everyone
is busy with prom and graduation and schedules. Next Friday is their last day of school. And then
prom is on Tuesday, which I thought was strange because I thought it would be on a weekend, but
Sam told me that every school can’t have their prom on the same night or else there wouldn’t be
enough tuxedos and restaurants to go around. I said it felt very well planned. And then Sunday is
their graduation. It all feels very exciting. I wish it were happening to me.
 I wonder what it will be like when I leave this place. The fact that I will have to have a roommate
and buy shampoo. I thought how great it would be to go to my senior prom three years from
now with Sam. I hope it’s on a Friday. And I hope I will be a valedictorian at graduation. I wonder
what my speech would be. And if Bill would help me with it if he didn’t go to New York and
write plays. Or maybe he would even if he was in New York writing plays. I think that would be
especially nice of him.
 I don’t know. The Fountainhead is a very good book. I hope I am being a filter.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 2, 1992 Dear friend,
 Did you have a senior prank? I’m guessing you probably did because my sister said it’s a tradi-
95
tion at a lot of schools. This year, the prank was as follows: Some seniors filled the swimming pool
with about six thousand packages of grape Kool-Aid. I have no idea who thinks of these things
or why, except that the senior prank is supposed to signify the end of school. What this has to do
with a grape pool is beyond me, but I was very happy not to have gym.
 It’s actually been a very exciting time because we’ve all been busy finishing up the year. This
Friday is the last day of school for all of my friends and my sister. They’ve been talking about their
prom nonstop. Even the people that think it’s a “joke” like Mary Elizabeth can’t stop talking about
what a “joke” it is. It’s all very fun to witness.
 So, by this time, everyone has finally figured out which schools he or she is going to next year.
Patrick is going to the University of Washington because he wants to be near the music there. He
says he thinks he wants to work for a record company someday. Maybe be a publicist or a person
who finds new bands. Sam finally made her decision to leave early for the summer program at
the college of her choice. I love that expression. College of my choice. Safety school is another
favorite.
 The thing was that Sam got into two schools. The college of her choice and a safety school.
She could have started at the safety school in the fall, but in order to go to the college of her
choice, she had to do this special summer program just like my brother. That’s right! The school
is Penn State, which is so great because now I can visit my brother and Sam with one trip. I don’t
want to think about Sam leaving just yet, but I did wonder what would happen if she and my
brother ever started dating, which is stupid because they are nothing alike, and Sam is in love with
Craig. I have to stop doing this.
 My sister is going to a “small liberal arts college back East” called Sarah Lawrence. She almost
didn’t get to go because it costs a lot of money, but then she got an academic scholarship through
the Rotary Club or Moose Lodge or something like that, which I thought was very generous of
them. My sister is going to be second in her class. I thought she might have been valedictorian,
but she got a B when she was going through that tough time with her old boyfriend.
 Mary Elizabeth is going to Berkeley. And Alice is going to study movies at New York University.
I never even knew she liked movies, but I guess she does. She calls them “films.”
 Incidentally, I finished The Fountainhead. It was a really great experience. It’s strange to describe
reading a book as a really great experience, but that’s kind of how it felt. It was a different
book from the others because it wasn’t about being a kid. And it wasn’t like The Stranger or Naked
Lunch even though I think it was philosophical in a way. But it wasn’t like you had to really search
for the philosophy. It was pretty straightforward, I thought, and the great part is that I took what
the author wrote about and put it in terms of my own life. Maybe that’s what being a filter means.
I’m not sure.
 There was this one part where the main character, who is this architect, is sitting on a boat with
his best friend, who is a newspaper tycoon. And the newspaper tycoon says that the architect is a
very cold man. The architect replies that if the boat were sinking, and there was only room in the
lifeboat for one person, he would gladly give up his life for the newspaper tycoon. And then he
says something like this ...
96
 “I would die for you. But I won’t live for you.”
 Something like that. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and
then make the choice to share it with other people. Maybe that is what makes people “participate.”
I’m not really certain. Because I don’t know if I would mind living for Sam for a while. Then
again, she wouldn’t want me to, so maybe it’s a lot friendlier than all that. I hope so anyway.
 I told my psychiatrist about the book and Bill and about Sam and Patrick and all their colleges,
but he just keeps asking me questions about when I was younger. The thing is I feel that I’m just
repeating the same memories to him. I don’t know. He says it’s important. I guess we’ll have to
see.
 I would write a little more today, but I have to learn my math formulas for the final on Thursday.
Wish me luck!
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 5, 1992 Dear friend,
 I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset. And there was this hill.
The hill up to the eighteenth green where Patrick and I spit wine from laughing. And just a few
hours before, Sam and Patrick and everyone I love and know had their last day of high school ever.
And I was happy because they were happy. My sister even let me hug her in the hallway. Congratulations
was the word of the day. So, Sam and Patrick and I went to the Big Boy and smoked
cigarettes. Then, we went walking, waiting for it to be time to go to Rocky Horror. And we were
talking about things that seemed important at the time. And we were looking up that hill. And
then Patrick started running after the sunset. And Sam immediately followed him. And I saw them
in silhouette. Running after the sun. Then, I started running. And everything was as good as it
could be.
 That night, Patrick decided to play Frank ‘n Furter one last time. He was so happy to put on
the costume, and everyone was happy he decided to do it. It was quite moving actually. He gave
the best show I ever saw him give. Maybe I was biased, but I don’t care. It was the show I’ll always
remember. Especially his last song.
 The song is called “I’m Going Home.” In the movie, Tim Curry, who plays the character, cries
during that song. But Patrick was smiling. And it felt just right.
 I even persuaded my sister to come to the show with her boyfriend. I have been trying to get
her to come since I started going, but she never would. But this time she did. And since she and
her boyfriend never saw the show before, they were technically “virgins,” which meant they would
have to do all these embarrassing things before the show started to get “initiated.” I decided not to
tell my sister this, and she and her boyfriend had to go on stage and try to dance the Time Warp.
 Whoever lost the dance contest had to pretend he or she was having sex with a large stuffed
Gumby doll, so I quickly showed my sister and her boyfriend how to dance the Time Warp, so they
97
wouldn’t lose the contest. It was fun watching my sister dance the Time Warp on stage, but I don’t
think I could have handled her pretending to have sex with a large stuffed Gumby.
 I asked my sister if she wanted to come to Craig’s for the party afterward, but she said that one
of her friends was having a party, so she was going to that. That was okay with me because at least
she came to the show. And before she left, she hugged me again. Two in one day! I really do love
my sister. Especially when she’s nice.
 The party at Craig’s was great. Craig and Peter bought champagne to congratulate all the people
who were graduating. And we danced. And we talked. And I saw Mary Elizabeth kissing Peter
and looking happy. And I saw Sam kissing Craig and looking happy. And I saw Patrick and Alice
not even care that they weren’t kissing anybody because they were too excited talking about their
futures.
 So, I just sat there with a bottle of champagne near the CD player, and I changed the songs
to fit the mood of what I saw. I was lucky, too, because Craig has an excellent collection. When
people looked a little tired, I played something fun. When they looked like they wanted to talk, I
played something soft. It was a great way to sit alone at a party and still feel a part of things.
 After the party, everyone thanked me because they said it was the perfect music. Craig said that
I should be a deejay to make money while I was still in school just like he does modeling. I thought
that was a good idea. Maybe I could save up a lot of money, so I would be able to go to college
even if something like the Rotary Club or Moose Lodge didn’t come through.
 My brother said recently on the phone that if he makes it to the pros, I don’t have to worry
about my college money at all. He said he’d take care of it. I can’t wait to see my brother. He’s
coming home for my sister’s graduation, which is so nice.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 9, 1992 Dear friend,
 It is now prom night. And I am sitting in my room. Yesterday was difficult because I didn’t
know anybody since all my friends and my sister were no longer in school.
 The worst was lunchtime because it reminded me of when everyone was angry with me for
Mary Elizabeth. I couldn’t even eat my sandwich, and my mom made my favorite because I think
she knew how sad I would be with everyone gone.
 The halls seemed different. And the juniors were acting different because they are now the seniors.
They even had T-shirts made. I don’t know who plans these things.
 All I can think about is the fact that Sam is leaving in two weeks to go to Penn State. And Mary
Elizabeth is going to be busy with her guy. And my sister is going to be busy with hers. And Alice
and I aren’t that close. I know Patrick will be around, but I’m afraid that maybe since he isn’t sad,
he won’t want to spend time with me. I know that’s wrong in my head, but it feels that way sometimes.
So, then the only person I would have to talk to would be my psychiatrist, and I don’t like
98
the idea of that right now because he keeps asking me questions about when I was younger, and
they’re starting to get weird.
 I’m just lucky that I have so much schoolwork and don’t have a lot of time to think.
 All I hope is that tonight is great for the people whom it’s supposed to be great for. My sister’s
boyfriend showed up in his Buick, and he was wearing a white “tails” coat over a black suit, which
looked wrong for some reason. His “cumberbunn” (I don’t know how to spell this) matched my
sister’s dress, which was powder blue and low-cut. It reminded me of those magazines. I have to
stop spinning out like this. Okay.
 All I hope is that my sister feels beautiful, and her new guy makes her feel beautiful. I hope that
Craig doesn’t make Sam feel that her prom isn’t special just because he’s older. I hope the same
for Mary Elizabeth with Peter. I hope Brad and Patrick decide to make up and dance in front of
the whole school. And that Alice is secretly a lesbian and in love with Brad’s girlfr Nancy (and vice
versa), so nobody feels left out. I hope the deejay is as good as everyone said I was last Friday.
And I hope everyone’s pictures turn out great and never become old photographs and nobody gets
in a car accident.
 That is what I really hope.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 10, 1992 Dear friend,
 I just got home from school, and my sister is still asleep from the after-prom party the school
organized. I called over to Patrick and Sam’s, but they’re still asleep, too. Patrick and Sam have a
cordless phone which always runs out of batteries, and Sam’s mom sounded like a mom in the Peanuts
cartoons. Wah Wah ... Wuh.
 I had two finals today. One in biology, which I think I got a perfect in. The other in Bill’s class.
The final was about The Great Gatsby. The only thing hard about it was the fact that he had me
read the book so long ago, and it was difficult to remember.
 After I handed in the final, I asked Bill if he wanted me to write an essay about The Fountainhead,
since I told him that I had finished it, and he hadn’t told me to do anything. He said that
it wouldn’t be fair to have me write another essay when I have so many finals this week. Instead,
he invited me over to his town house to spend Saturday afternoon with his girlfr and him, which
sounds like fun.
 So, on Friday, I will go to Rocky Horror. Then, on Saturday, I will go over to Bill’s town house.
Then, on Sunday, I will watch everyone graduate and spend time with my brother and all the family
because of my sister. Then, I’ll probably go to Sam and Patrick’s to celebrate their graduating.
Then, I’ll have two more days of school, which doesn’t make sense because all my finals will be
over. But they have some activities planned. At least that’s what I’ve heard.
 The reason I am thinking so far in advance is because school is terribly lonely. I think I’ve
99
said that before, but it’s getting harder every day. I have two finals tomorrow. History and typing.
Then, on Friday, I have finals in all my other classes like gym and shop. I don’t know if there will
be actual finals in these classes. Especially shop. I think Mr. Callahan will just play some of his
old records for us. He did that when we were supposed to have a midterm, too, but it won’t be the
same without Patrick lip-synching. Incidentally, I got a perfect on my math final last week.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 13, 1992 Dear friend,
 I just got home from Bill’s house. I would have written to you about last night this morning,
but I had to go to Bill’s.
 Last night, Craig and Sam broke up.
 It was very sad to watch. In the past few days, I have heard a lot about the prom, and thanks
to those twenty-four-hour film places, I have seen what everyone looked like. Sam looked beautiful.
Patrick looked handsome. Mary Elizabeth, Alice, Mary Elizabeth’s boyfriend all looked great,
too. The only thing is that Alice wore white stick deodorant with a strapless dress, and it showed. I
don’t think that kind of thing matters, but supposedly Alice was paranoid about it all night. Craig
looked handsome as well, but he wore a suit instead of a tux. That’s not why they broke up.
 Actually, the prom was supposed to be very nice. The limo was really great, and the limo driver
got everyone stoned, which made the very expensive food taste even better. His name was Billy.
The prom’s music came from this really bad cover band called The Gypsies of the Allegheny, but
the drummer was good, so everyone had a nice time dancing. Patrick and Brad didn’t even look at
each other, but Sam said Patrick was really okay about it.
 After the prom, my sister and her boyfriend went to the after-prom party the school organized.
It was at this popular dance club downtown. She said that it was really fun with everyone all
dressed up and dancing to good music played by a deejay instead of The Gypsies of the Allegheny.
They even had a comedian who did impersonations. The only thing was that once you went in, you
couldn’t leave and come back. I guess the parents thought that it would keep the kids out of trouble.
But nobody seemed to mind. They were having too much fun, and enough people smuggled
in liquor anyway.
 After the party, it was about seven o’clock in the morning and everyone went to the Big Boy for
pancakes or bacon.
 I asked Patrick how he liked the after-prom party, and he said that it was a lot of fun. He said
that Craig had rented a hotel suite for all of them, but only Craig and Sam went. Actually, Sam
wanted to go to the after-prom party the school organized, too, but Craig got really angry because
he already paid for the hotel suite. That’s not why they broke up.
 It happened yesterday at Craig’s house after Rocky Horror. Like I said, Mary Elizabeth’s boyfriend,
Peter, is good friends with Craig, and he kind of stepped into the middle of things. I guess
100
he really likes Mary Elizabeth a lot and has grown to like Sam quite a bit because he’s the one who
brought it up. Nobody even suspected.
 Basically, Craig had been cheating on Sam ever since they started going out. And when I say
cheat, I don’t mean he got drunk once and fooled around with one girl and felt bad about it. There
were several girls. Several times. Drunk and sober. And I guess he never felt bad.
 The reason Peter didn’t say anything at first was the fact that he didn’t know anybody. And he
didn’t know Sam. He just thought she was this dumb high school girl because that’s what Craig
always told him.
 Anyway, after he got to know Sam, Peter kept telling Craig that Craig had to tell her the truth
because she wasn’t just some dumb high school girl. Craig kept promising he would, but he never
did it. There was always some excuse. Craig called them “reasons.”
 “I don’t want to ruin the prom for her.”
 “I don’t want to ruin graduation for her.”
 “I don’t want to ruin the show for her.”
 Then, finally, Craig said there was no point telling her anything at all. She was about to go away
to college anyway. She would find a new guy. He was always “safe” about other girls. There was
nothing to worry about in that way. And why not just let Sam remember the whole experience in a
good way? Because he really liked Sam and didn’t want to hurt her feelings.
 Peter went along with this logic even though he thought it was wrong. At least that’s what he
said. But then after the show yesterday, Craig told him that he fooled around with yet another girl
the afternoon of the prom. That’s when Peter told Craig that if Craig didn’t say something to Sam,
he would. Well, Craig didn’t say anything, and Peter still didn’t think it was his business, but then
he overheard Sam at the party. She was talking to Mary Elizabeth about how Craig might be “the
one” and how she was trying to think of ways to keep it going long-.tance while she was at school.
Letters. Phone calls. Vacations. And breaks. That was it for Peter.
 He went up to Craig and said, “You tell her something now, or I tell her everything.”
 So, Craig pulled Sam into his bedroom. They were in there for a while. Then, Sam walked from
the bedroom straight out the front door, silently sobbing. Craig didn’t run after her. That was
probably the worst part. Not that he should have tried to get back together with her, but I think he
should have run after her anyway.
 All I know is that Sam was devastated. Mary Elizabeth and Alice went after her to make sure
she was okay. I would have gone, too, but Patrick grabbed my arm to stay. He wanted to know
what was going on, I guess, or maybe he figured Sam would be better off with female company.
 I’m glad that we stayed, though, because I think our presence prevented a pretty violent fight
between Craig and Peter. Because we were there, all they really did was scream at each other.
That’s where I heard most of the details I’m writing to you about.
 Craig would say, “Fuck you, Peter! Fuck you!”
 And Peter would say, “Don’t blame me that you fucked around on her since the beginning! The
afternoon of her prom!? You’re just a bastard! You hear me?! A fucking bastard!”
101
 Things like that.
 When it looked like things were going to get violent, Patrick stepped between the two and, with
my help, got Peter out of the apartment. When we got outside, the girls were gone. So, Patrick
and I got into Patrick’s car and drove Peter home. He was still seething, so he “vented” about
Craig. That’s where I heard the rest of the details I’m writing to you about. Finally, we dropped
Peter off, and he made us promise to make sure Mary Elizabeth didn’t think he was cheating on her
because he wasn’t. He just didn’t want to be found “guilty by association” with that “prick.”
 We promised, and he went into his apartment building.
 Patrick and I weren’t sure how much Craig actually told Sam. We both hoped he gave her a
“soft” version of the truth. Enough to make her stay away. But not enough to make her doubt
everything about everything. Maybe it’s better to know the whole truth. I honestly don’t know.
 So, we just made a pact that we wouldn’t tell her unless we found out that Craig made it sound
like “nothing big,” and Sam was ready to forgive him. I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope Craig
told her enough to make her stay away.
 We drove around to all the places where we thought we might find the girls, but we couldn’t find
them. Patrick figured they were probably just driving around, trying to let Sam “cool off a bit.”
 So, Patrick dropped me at home. He said he’d call me tomorrow when he heard anything.
 I remember going to sleep last night, and I realized something. Something that I think is important.
I realized that throughout the course of the evening, I wasn’t happy about Craig and Sam
breaking up. Not at all.
 I never once thought that it would mean Sam might start liking me. All I cared about was the
fact that Sam got really hurt. And I guess I realized at that moment that I really did love her. Because
there was nothing to gain, and that didn’t matter.
 It was hard walking up the steps to Bill’s town house that afternoon because I didn’t receive a
phone call all morning from Patrick. And I was so worried about Sam. I called on the phone, but
nobody was there.
 Bill looks different without a suit. He was wearing his old graduate school T-shirt. Which was
Brown. The school. Not the color. His girlfr was wearing sandals and a nice flowered dress. She
even had hair under her arms. No kidding! They looked very happy together. And I was glad for
Bill.
 Their house didn’t have a lot of furniture in it, but it was very comfortable. They had a lot of
books, which I spent about a half an hour asking them about. There was also a picture of Bill and
his girlfr when they were at Brown together in graduate school. Bill had very long hair then.
 Bill’s girlfr made lunch while Bill made the salad. I just sat in the kitchen, drinking a ginger ale,
and watching them. The lunch was a spaghetti dish of some sort because Bill’s girlfr doesn’t eat
meat. Bill doesn’t eat meat either now. The salad did have imitation bacon bits, though, because
bacon is the only thing they both miss.
 They had a really nice collection of jazz records, and they kept playing them all through lunch.
After a while, they broke open a bottle of white wine and gave me another ginger ale. Then, we
102
started talking.
 Bill asked me about The Fountainhead, and I told him, making sure that I was a filter.
 Then, he asked me about how I liked my first year of high school, and I told him, making sure
that I included all the stories in which I “participated.”
 Then, he asked me about girls, and I told him how I really loved Sam, and how I wondered what
the lady who wrote The Fountainhead would say about how I came to realize that I loved her.
 After I finished, Bill got very quiet. He cleared his throat.
 “Charlie ... I want to thank you.”
 “Why?” I said.
 “Because it has been a wonderful experience teaching you.”
 “Oh ... I’m glad.” I didn’t know what else to say.
 Then, Bill took this really long pause, and his voice sounded like my dad when he wants to have
a big talk.
 “Charlie,” he said. “Do you know why I gave you all that extra work?”
 I shook my head no. That look on his face. It made me quiet.
 “Charlie, do you know how smart you are?”
 I just shook my head no again. He was talking for real. It was strange.
 “Charlie, you’re one of the most gifted people I’ve ever known. And I don’t mean in terms of
my other students. I mean in terms of anyone I’ve ever met. That’s why I gave you the extra work.
I was wondering if you were aware of that?”
 “I guess so. I don’t know.” I felt really strange. I didn’t know where this was coming from. I
just wrote some essays.
 “Charlie. Please don’t take this the wrong way. I’m not trying to make you feel uncomfortable.
I just want you to know that you’re very special ... and the only reason I’m telling you is that I don’t
know if anyone else ever has.”
 I looked up at him. And then I didn’t feel strange. I felt like I wanted to cry. He was being so
nice to me, and the way his girlfr looked, I knew that this meant a lot to him. And I didn’t know
why it did.
 “So, when the school year ends, and I’m not your teacher anymore, I want you to know that
if you ever need anything, or want to know about more books, or want to show me anything you
write, or anything, you can always come to me as a friend. I do consider you a friend, Charlie.”
 I started crying a little bit. I actually think his girlfr was, too. But Bill wasn’t. He looked very
solid. I just remember wanting to hug him. But I’ve never done that before, and I guess Patrick
and girls and family don’t count. I didn’t say anything for a while because I didn’t know what to say.
 So, finally I just said, “You’re the best teacher I ever had.”
 And he said, “Thank you.”
103
 And that was that. Bill didn’t try to make sure that I would see him next year if I needed anything.
He didn’t ask me why I was crying. He just let me hear what he had to say in my own way
and let things be. That was probably the best part.
 After a few minutes, it was time for me to leave. I don’t know who decides these things. It just
happens.
 So, we went to the door, and Bill’s girlfr hugged me good-bye, which was very nice considering
I didn’t know her except for today. Then, Bill extended his hand, and I took it. And we shook
hands. And I even sneaked in a quick hug before I said “good-bye.”
 When I was driving home, I just thought about the word “special.” And I thought the last person
who said that about me was my aunt Helen. I was very grateful to have heard it again. Because
I guess we all forget sometimes. And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do.
 My brother gets home tonight. And everyone’s graduation is tomorrow. Patrick still hasn’t
called. I called him, but no one was home again. So, I decided to go out and buy everyone their
graduation presents. I really haven’t had time to do that until now.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 16, 1992 Dear friend,
 I just rode home on the bus. It was the last day of school for me today. And it was raining.
When I do ride the bus, I usually sit toward the middle because I’ve heard sitting in the front is for
nerds and sitting in the back is for squids, and the whole thing makes me nervous. I don’t know
what they call “squids” in other schools.
 Anyway, today I decided to sit in the front with my legs over the whole seat. Kind of like I was
lying down with my back to the window. I did this so I could look back at the other kids on the
bus. I’m glad school buses don’t have seat belts, or else I wouldn’t have been able to do it.
 The one thing I noticed was how different everyone looked. When we were all little, we used to
sing songs on the bus ride home from the last day of school. The favorite song was a Pink Floyd
song, I found out later, called Another Brick in the Wall, Part II. But there was this other song we
loved even more because it ended with a swear. It went like this ...
 No more pencils ar no more books ar no more teachers’ dirty looks ar when the teacher rings
the bell ar drop your books and run like hell.
 When we finished, we looked at the bus driver for a tense second. Then, we all laughed because
we knew we could get in trouble for swearing, but the strength of our numbers would prevent any
retribution. We were too young to know that the bus driver didn’t care about our song. That all
he wanted to do was go home after work. And maybe sleep off the drinks he had at lunch. Back
then, it didn’t matter. The nerds and the squids were one.
 My brother came home Saturday night. And he looked even more different than the kids on
104
the school bus looked compared to the beginning of the year. He had a beard! I was so happy! He
also smiled different and was more “courteous.” We all sat down to dinner, and everyone asked him
questions about college. Dad asked about football. Mom asked about classes. I asked for all the
fun stories. My sister asked nervous questions about what college is “really” like and would she put
on the “freshman fifteen”? I don’t know what this is, but I’m guessing it means you get fatter.
 I was expecting my brother to just talk and talk about himself for a long time. He would do
that whenever there was a big game in high school or the prom or something. But he seemed a lot
more interested in what we were all doing, especially my sister with her graduation.
 So, while they were talking, I suddenly remembered the TV news sports man and what he said
about my brother. I got so excited. And I told my whole family. And this is what happened as a
result.
 My dad said, “Hey! How about that?!”
 My brother said, “Really!?”
 I said, “Yeah. I talked to him.”
 My brother said, “Did he say something good?”
 My father said, “Any press is good press.” I don’t know where my father learns these things.
 My brother kept going. “What did he say?”
 I said, “Well, I think he said that college sports puts a lot of pressure on the students who do
them.” My brother kept nodding. “But he said that it built character. And he said that Penn State
was looking really good with their recruitment. And he mentioned you.”
 My dad said, “Hey! How about that?”
 My brother said, “Really?”
 I said, “Yeah. I talked to him.”
 My brother said, “When did you talk to him?”
 I said, “A couple weeks ago.”
 And then I froze because I suddenly remembered the other part. The fact that I met the man in
the park at night. And the fact that I gave him one of my cigarettes. And the fact that he was trying
to pick me up. I just sat there, hoping it would go away. But it didn’t.
 “Where did you meet him, honey?” my mom asked.
 The room turned pins and needles quiet. And I did my best impersonation of myself when I
can’t remember something. And here’s what’s going on inside my head.
 Okay ... he came to school to have a talk with the class ... no ... my sister would know it was a
lie ... I met him at the Big Boy ... he was with his family ... no ... my dad would scold me for bothering
the “poor man” ... he said it on a news cast ... but I said I talked to him ... wait ...
 “In the park. I was there with Patrick,” I said.
 My dad said, “Was he there with his family? Did you bother the poor man?”
 “No. He was alone.”
105
 That was enough for my dad and everybody else, and I didn’t even have to lie. Luckily, the
attention was turned off me when my mother said what she likes to say when we’re all together
celebrating something.
 “Who’s in the mood for ice cream?”
 Everyone was except for my sister. I think she was worried about the “freshman fifteen.”
 The next morning started early. I still hadn’t heard from Patrick or Sam or anybody, but I knew
I would see them at graduation, so I tried not to worry too much. All my relatives, including my
dad’s family from Ohio, came to the house around ten A.M. The two families really don’t like each
other, except for all us younger cousins because we don’t know any better.
 We had this big brunch with champagne, and just like last year for my brother’s graduation, my
mom gave her dad (my grandfather) sparkling apple juice instead of champagne because she didn’t
want him to get drunk and make a scene. And he said the same thing he said last year.
 “This is good champagne.”
 I don’t think he knew the difference because he’s a beer drinker. Sometimes, whiskey.
 Around twelve-thirty, brunch was over. All the cousins drove all the cars because the adults
were still a little too drunk to drive to the graduation. Except for my dad, because he was too busy
videotaping everyone with a camera he rented from the video store.
 “Why buy a camera when you only need it three times a year?”
 So, my sister, brother, dad, mom, and I each had to go in a different car to make sure nobody
got lost. I went with all my Ohio cousins, who promptly pulled out a “joint” and passed it around.
I didn’t smoke any of it because I wasn’t in the mood, and they said what they always say.
 “Charlie, you’re such a pussy.”
 So, all the cars pulled into the parking lot, and we all got out. And my sister yelled at my cousin
Mike for rolling down the window while he was driving and messing up her hair.
 “I was smoking a cigarette,” was his reply.
 “Couldn’t you wait ten minutes?” was my sister’s.
 “But it was a great song,” was his final word.
 So, as my dad was getting the video camera out of the trunk, and my brother was talking to
some of the graduating girls who were a year older and “looking good,” my sister went for my
mom to get my mom’s purse. The great thing about my mom’s purse is that no matter what you
need at any given moment, she has it. When I was little, I used to call it the “first-aid kit” because
that’s all we needed back then. I still can’t figure out how she does it.
 After primping, my sister followed the trail of graduation caps to the field, and we all found our
way to the bleachers. I sat in between my mom and brother since my dad was off getting a better
camera angle. And my mom kept shushing my grandfather, who kept talking about how many
black people were in the school.
 When she couldn’t stop him, she mentioned my story about the TV news sports man talking
about my brother. This made my grandfather call my brother over to talk about it. This was smart
106
on my mom’s part because my brother is the only person who can get my grandfather to stop making
a scene because he’s really direct about it. After the story, this is what happened ...
 “Jesus. Look at these bleachers. How many colored people--” My brother cut him off.
 “Okay, Grandpa. Here’s the deal. If you embarrass us one more time, I’m going to drive you
back to the nursing home, and you’ll never see your granddaughter give a speech.” My brother is
real tough.
 “But then you won’t see the speech either, big shot.” My grandfather’s real tough, too.
 “Yeah, but my dad is videotaping it. And I can arrange it so I get to see the tape, and you don’t.
Can’t I?”
 My grandfather has a really weird smile. Especially when someone else wins. He didn’t say anything
more about it. He just started talking about football and didn’t even mention anything about
my brother playing on a team with black kids. I can’t tell you how bad it was last year since my
brother was on the field graduating instead of up in the bleachers making my grandfather stop.
 While they were talking football, I kept looking for Patrick and Sam, but all I saw were those
graduation caps in the distance. When the music started, the caps started marching toward the
folding chairs set up on the field. That’s when I finally saw Sam walking behind Patrick. I was so
relieved. I couldn’t really tell if she was happy or sad, but it was enough just to see her and know
that she was there.
 When all the kids got in the chairs, the music stopped. And Mr. Small got up and gave a speech
about what a wonderful class this was. He mentioned some of the achievements the school had
made, and he emphasized how much they needed support at the Community Day Bake Sale to start
a new computer lab. Then, he introduced the class president, who gave a speech. I don’t know
what class presidents do, but the girl gave a very good speech.
 Then, it was time for the five top honor students to give a speech. That’s the tradition in the
school. My sister was second in her class, so she gave the fourth speech. The valedictorian is always
last. Then, Mr. Small and the vice principal, whom Patrick swears is gay, hand out the diplomas.
 The first three speeches were very similar. They all had quotes from pop songs that had something
to do with the future. And all through the speeches, I could see my mother’s hands. She was
gripping them tighter and tighter together.
 When they announced my sister’s name, my mom uncoiled into applause. It was really great
watching my sister get on the podium because my brother was something like 223rd in his class
and consequently didn’t get to give a speech. And maybe I’m biased, but when my sister quoted a
pop song and talked about the future, it seemed great. I looked over at my brother, and he looked
over at me. And we both smiled. Then, we looked at my mother, and she was crying real soft and
messy, so my brother and I each took one of her hands. She looked at us and smiled and cried
harder. Then, we both rested our heads on her shoulders, like a sideways hug, which made her cry
even harder. Or maybe it let her cry even harder. I’m not sure which. But she gave our hands a
little squeeze and said, “My boys,” real soft, and went back to crying. I love my mom so much. I
don’t care if that’s corny to say. I think on my next birthday, I’m going to buy her a present. I
107
think that should be the tradition. The kid gets gifts from everybody, and he buys one present for
his mom since she was there, too. I think that would be nice.
 When my sister finished her speech, we all clapped and yelled, but nobody clapped or yelled
louder than my grandfather. Nobody.
 I don’t remember what the valedictorian said except that she quoted Henry David Thoreau instead
of a pop song.
 Then, Mr. Small got up on the stage and asked everyone to refrain from applause until all the
names were read and all the diplomas were handed out. I should mention that this didn’t work last
year either.
 So, I saw my sister get her diploma and my mother cry again. And then I saw Mary Elizabeth.
And I saw Alice. And I saw Patrick. And I saw Sam. It was a great day. Even when I saw Brad. It
seemed okay.
 We all met my sister in the parking lot, and the first one to hug her was my grandfather. He
really is a proud man in his way. Everyone said how much they loved my sister’s speech even if
they didn’t. Then, we all saw my father walking across the parking lot, holding the video camera
above his head triumphantly. I don’t think anybody hugged my sister longer than my dad. I looked
around for Sam and Patrick, but I couldn’t find them anywhere.
 On the way home for the party, my Ohio cousins lit up another joint. This time, I took a hit,
but they still called me a “pussy.” I don’t know why. Maybe that’s just what Ohio cousins do. That
and tell jokes.
 “What has 32 legs and 1 tooth?”
 “What?” we all asked.
 “A West Virginia unemployment line.”
 Things like that.
 When we got home, my Ohio cousins went straight for the bar because graduations seem to be
the one occasion where anyone can drink. At least it was like that last year and this year. I wonder
what my graduation will be like. It seems very far away.
 So, my sister spent the first hour of the party opening up all the gifts, and her smile grew with
each check, sweater, or fifty dollar bill. Nobody in our family is rich, but it seems like everybody
saves up just enough for these kind of events, and we all pretend we’re rich for a day.
 The only people who didn’t get my sister money or a sweater were my brother and I. My brother
promised to take her out one day to shop for college things like soap, which he would pay for,
and I bought her a little house that was hand-carved out of stone and painted in England. I told
her I wanted to give her something that makes her feel like she’s at home even after she goes away.
My sister actually kissed my cheek for that.
 But the best part of the party happened when my mother came to me and said I had a phone
call. I went to the phone.
 “Hello?”
108
 “Charlie?”
 “Sam!”
 “When are you coming over?” she asked. “Now!” I said.
 Then, my father, who was drinking a whiskey sour, growled, “You’re not going anywhere until
your relatives leave. You hear me?”
 “Uh, Sam ... I have to wait for my relatives to leave,” I said.
 “Okay ... we’ll be here until seven. Then, we’ll call you from wherever we are.” Sam really
sounded happy.
 “Okay, Sam. Congratulations!”
 “Thanks, Charlie. Bye.”
 “Bye.”
 I hung up the phone.
 I swear to you, I thought my relatives would never leave. Every story they told. Every pig in
a blanket they ate. Every photograph they looked at, and every time I heard “when you were this
high” with the appropriate gesture. It was like the clock stopped. It’s not that I minded the stories
because I didn’t. And the pigs in blankets were quite good. But I wanted to see Sam.
 At about 9:30, everyone was stuffed and sober. At 9:45, the hugs were over. At 9:50, the driveway
was clear. My father gave me twenty dollars and the keys to his car, saying, “Thanks for sticking
around. It meant a lot to me and the family.” He was tipsy, but meant it just the same. Sam
had told me they were going to a dance club downtown. So, I loaded everyone’s gifts in my trunk,
climbed in the car, and drove away.
 There’s something about that tunnel that leads to downtown. It’s glorious at night. Just glorious.
You start on one side of the mountain, and it’s dark, and the radio is loud. As you enter the
tunnel, the wind gets sucked away, and you squint from the lights overhead. When you adjust to
the lights, you can see the other side in the distance just as the sound of the radio fades to nothing
because the waves just can’t reach. Then, you’re in the middle of the tunnel, and everything becomes
a calm dream. As you see the opening get closer, you just can’t get there fast enough. And
finally, just when you think you’ll never get there, you see the opening right in front of you. And
the radio comes back even louder than you remember it. And the wind is waiting. And you fly out
of the tunnel onto the bridge. And there it is. The city. A million lights and buildings and everything
seems as exciting as the first time you saw it. It really is a grand entrance.
 After about half an hour looking around the dance club, I finally saw Mary Elizabeth with Peter.
They were both drinking scotch and sodas, which Peter bought since he is older and had his hand
stamped. I congratulated Mary Elizabeth and asked where everybody was. She told me that Alice
was getting high in the ladies’ room and Sam and Patrick were on the floor dancing. She said to
just have a seat until they come back because she didn’t know where they were specifically. So, I sat
down and listened to Peter argue with Mary Elizabeth about the Democratic candidates. Again, the
clock seemed to stop. I wanted to see Sam that badly.
 After about three songs, Sam and Patrick came back completely coated in sweat.
109
 “Charlie!”
 I stood up, and we all hugged like we hadn’t seen each other in months. Considering everything
that happened, I guess that makes sense. After we let go, Patrick lay on top of Peter and Mary
Elizabeth like they were a sofa. Then, he took Mary Elizabeth’s drink out of her hand and drank it.
“Hey, asshole” was her response. I think he was drunk, even though he hasn’t been drinking lately,
but Patrick does that stuff sober, so it’s hard to tell.
 That’s when Sam grabbed my hand. “I love this song!”
 She led me to the dance floor. And she started dancing. And I started dancing. It was a fast
song, so I wasn’t very good, but she didn’t seem to mind. We were just dancing, and that was
enough. The song ended, and then a slow one came on. She looked at me. I looked at her. Then,
she took my hands and pulled me in to dance slow. I don’t know how to dance slow very well either,
but I do know how to sway.
 Her whisper smelled like cranberry juice and vodka.
 “I looked for you in the parking lot today.”
 I hoped mine still smelled like toothpaste.
 “I was looking for you, too.”
 Then, we were quiet for the rest of the song. She held me a little closer. I held her a little closer.
And we kept dancing. It was the one time all day that I really wanted the clock to stop. And
just be there for a long time.
 After the dance club, we went back to Peter’s apartment, and I gave everyone their graduation
presents. I gave Alice a film book about Night of the Living Dead, which she liked, and I gave
Mary Elizabeth a copy of My Life as a Dog on videotape with the subtitles in it, which she loved.
 Then, I gave Patrick and Sam their presents. I even wrapped them up special. I used the Sunday
funny papers because they are in color. Patrick tore through his. Sam didn’t rip any of the
paper. She just plucked off the tape. And they looked at what was inside each box.
 I gave Patrick On the Road, Naked Lunch, The Stranger, This Side of Paradise, Peter Pan, and
A Separate Peace.
 I gave Sam To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, Hamlet, Walden,
and The Fountainhead.
 Under the books was a card that I wrote using the typewriter Sam bought me. The cards said
that these were my copies of all my favorite books, and I wanted Sam and Patrick to have them
because they were my two favorite people in the whole world.
 When they both looked up from reading, they were quiet. Nobody smiled or cried or did anything.
We were just open, looking at each other. They knew I meant the cards I wrote. And I
knew it meant a lot to them.
 “What do the cards say?” Mary Elizabeth asked.
 “Do you mind, Charlie?” Patrick asked.
 I shook my head no, and they each read their cards while I went to fill up my coffee cup with
110
red wine.
 When I came back, they all looked at me, and I said, “I’m going to miss you all very much. I
hope you have a great time at college.” And then I started crying because it suddenly hit me that
they were all leaving. I think Peter thinks I’m a little strange. So, Sam stood up and took me into
the kitchen, telling me on the way there that it was “okay.” When we got to the kitchen, I was a little
more calm.
 Sam said, “You know I’m leaving in a week, Charlie?”
 “Yeah. I know.”
 “Don’t start crying again.”
 “Okay.”
 “I want you to listen.”
 “Okay.”
 “I’m really scared to be alone at college.”
 “You are?” I asked. I never really thought of that before.
 “Just like you’re really scared to be alone here.”
 “Okay.” I nodded.
 “So, I’ll make you a deal. When things get to be too much at college, I’ll call you, and when
things get to be too much here, you call me.”
 “Could we write letters back and forth?”
 “Of course,” she said.
 Then, I started crying again. I really am a roller-coaster sometimes. But Sam was patient.
 “Charlie, I’m going to be back at the end of the summer, but before we think about that, let’s
just enjoy this last week together. All of us. Okay?”
 I nodded and calmed down.
 We spent the rest of the night just drinking and listening to music like we always did, but this
time it was at Peter’s, and it was better than Craig’s, actually, because Peter has a better music collection.
It was about one o’clock in the morning when it suddenly occurred to me.
 “Oh my God!” I said.
 “What’s wrong, Charlie?”
 “Tomorrow’s a school day!”
 I don’t think I could have made them laugh harder.
 Peter took me into the kitchen to make coffee, so I could sober up to drive home. I had about
eight cups in a row and was ready to drive in about twenty minutes. The problem was, by the time
I got home, I was so awake from the coffee, I couldn’t fall asleep. By the time I got to school, I felt
like dying. Luckily, all the finals were over, and all we did all day was watch film strips. I don’t think
I ever slept better. I was glad, too, because school really is lonely without them.
111
 Today was different because I didn’t sleep, and I didn’t get to see Sam or Patrick last night because
they were having a special dinner out with their parents. And my brother was on a date with
one of the girls who was “looking good” at graduation. My sister was busy with her boyfriend.
And my mom and dad were still tired from the graduation party.
 Today, pretty much every teacher just let the kids sit around and talk after we handed in our textbooks.
I honestly didn’t know anybody, except maybe for Susan, but after that time in the hallway,
she’s avoided me more than ever. So, I didn’t really talk. The only good class was Bill’s because I
got to talk to Bill. It was hard saying good-bye to him after class was over, but he said that it wasn’t
good-bye. I could call him anytime over the summer if I wanted to talk or borrow books, and that
made me feel a little better.
 This one kid with crooked teeth named Leonard called me a “teacher’s pet” in the hallway after
Bill’s class, but I didn’t mind because I think he missed the point somewhere.
 I ate lunch outside on a bench where we all used to smoke. After I ate my Ho-Ho, I lit up a
cigarette, and I was kind of hoping someone would ask me for one, but no one did.
 When the last class was over, everyone was cheering and making plans with each other for the
summer. And everyone was clearing out their lockers by throwing their old papers and notes and
books on the hallway floor. When I got to my locker, I saw this skinny kid who had the locker next
to me all year. I had never really talked to him before.
 I cleared my throat and said, “Hey. My name is Charlie.”
 All he said was, “I know.”
 Then, he closed his locker door and walked away.
 So, I just opened my locker, put all my old papers and things in my backpack, and walked over
the debris of books and papers and notes in the hallway to the parking lot outside. Then, I got on
the bus. Then, I wrote this letter to you.
 I’m actually really glad that the school year is over. I want to spend a lot of time with everyone
before they leave. Especially Sam.
 By the way, I ended up getting straight A’s this whole year. My mother was very proud and put
my report card on the refrigerator.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 June 22, 1992 Dear friend,
 The night before Sam was going to leave made the whole week a blur. Sam was frantic because
not only did she need to spend time with us, but she had to get ready to go. Buying things. Packing
things. Things like that.
 Every night, we would all get together after Sam had just said good-bye to some uncle or had
another lunch with her mom or had done more shopping for school things. She was scared, and it
112
wasn’t until she had a sip of whatever we were drinking or a hit off of whatever we were smoking
that she would calm down and be the same Sam.
 The one thing that really helped Sam through her week was her lunch with Craig. She said she
wanted to see him to have some kind of “closure,” and I guess she was lucky enough to get it because
Craig was nice enough to tell her that she was right to break up with him. And that she was a
special person. And that he was sorry and wished her well. It’s strange the times people choose to
be generous.
 The best part was that Sam said she didn’t ask him about the girls he might be dating even
though she wanted to know. She wasn’t bitter. She was sad, though. But it was a hopeful kind of
sad. The kind of sad that just takes time.
 On the night before she left, we were all there at Sam and Patrick’s house. Bob, Alice, Mary
Elizabeth (without Peter), and I. We just sat on the rug in the “games” room, remembering things.
 Remember the show where Patrick did this ... or remember when Bob did this ... or Charlie ...
or Mary Elizabeth ... or Alice ... or Sam ...
 The inside jokes weren’t jokes anymore. They had become stories. Nobody brought up the bad
names or the bad times. And nobody felt sad as long as we could postpone tomorrow with more
nostalgia.
 After a while, Mary Elizabeth and Bob and Alice left, saying they would be back in the morning
to see Sam off. So, it was just me, Patrick, and Sam. Just sitting there. Not saying much. Until we
started our own remember when.
 Remember when Charlie first came to us at the football game ... and remember when Charlie
let the air out of Dave’s tires at the homecoming dance ... and remember the poem ... and the mix
tape ... and Punk Rocky in color ... and remember when we all felt infinite ...
 After I said that, we all got quiet and sad. In the silence, I remembered this one time that I never
told anybody about. The time we were walking. Just the three of us. And I was in the middle. I
don’t remember where we were walking to or where we were walking from. I don’t even remember
the season. I just remember walking between them and feeling for the first time that I belonged
somewhere.
 Finally, Patrick stood up.
 “I’m tired, guys. Good night.”
 Then, he messed up our hair and went up to his room. Sam turned to me.
 “Charlie, I have to pack up some things. Would you stay with me for a while?”
 I nodded, and we went upstairs.
 As we entered her room, I noticed how different it looked from the night Sam kissed me. The
pictures were down, and the dressers were empty, and everything was in a big pile on the bed. I
said to myself that I would not cry no matter what because I didn’t want to make Sam feel any
more panicked than she already was.
 So, I just watched her pack, and I tried to notice as many details as I possibly could. Her long
113
hair and her thin wrists and her green eyes. I wanted to remember everything. Especially the
sound of her voice.
 Sam talked about a lot of things, trying to keep herself distracted. She talked about what a long
drive they had tomorrow and how her parents had rented a van. She wondered what her classes
would be like and what her eventual “major” would be. She said she didn’t want to join a sorority
but was looking forward to the football games. She was just getting more and more sad. Finally,
she turned around.
 “Why didn’t you ask me out when the whole Craig thing happened?”
 I just sat there. I didn’t know what to say. She said it soft.
 “Charlie ... after that thing with Mary Elizabeth at the party and us dancing at the club and everything
...”
 I didn’t know what to say. Honestly, I was lost.
 “Okay, Charlie ... I’ll make this easy. When that whole thing with Craig happened, what did you
think?” She really wanted to know.
 I said, “Well, I thought a lot of things. But mostly, I thought that your being sad was much
more important to me than Craig not being your boyfriend anymore. And if it meant that I would
never get to think of you that way, as long as you were happy, it was okay. That’s when I realized
that I really loved you.”
 She sat down on the floor with me. She spoke quiet.
 “Charlie, don’t you get it? I can’t feel that. It’s sweet and everything, but it’s like you’re not even
there sometimes. It’s great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when
someone doesn’t need a shoulder. What if they need the arms or something like that? You can’t
just sit there and put everybody’s lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can’t.
You have to do things.”
 “Like what?” I asked. My mouth was dry.
 “I don’t know. Like take their hands when the slow song comes up for a change. Or be the one
who asks someone for a date. Or tell people what you need. Or what you want. Like on the dance
floor, did you want to kiss me?”
 “Yeah,” I said.
 “Then, why didn’t you?” she asked real serious.
 “Because I didn’t think you wanted me to.”
 “Why did you think that?”
 “Because of what you said.”
 “What I said nine months ago? When I told you not to think of me that way?”
 I nodded.
 “Charlie, I also told you not to tell Mary Elizabeth she was pretty. And to ask her a lot of questions
and not interrupt her. Now she’s with a guy who does the exact opposite. And it works
114
because that’s who Peter really is. He’s being himself. And he does things.”
 “But I didn’t like Mary Elizabeth.”
 “Charlie, you’re missing the point. The point is that I don’t think you would have acted different
even if you did like Mary Elizabeth. It’s like you can come to Patrick’s rescue and hurt two guys
that are trying to hurt him, but what about when Patrick’s hurting himself? Like when you guys
went to that park? Or when he was kissing you? Did you want him to kiss you?”
 I shook my head no.
 “So, why did you let him?”
 “I was just trying to be a friend,” I said.
 “But you weren’t, Charlie. At those times, you weren’t being his friend at all. Because you
weren’t honest with him.”
 I sat there very still. I looked at the floor. I didn’t say anything. Very uncomfortable.
 “Charlie, I told you not to think of me that way nine months ago because of what I’m saying
now. Not because of Craig. Not because I didn’t think you were great. It’s just that I don’t want to
be somebody’s crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I
am. And I don’t want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it, too.
I want them to be able to do whatever they want around me. And if they do something I don’t
like, I’ll tell them.”
 She was starting to cry a little. But she wasn’t sad.
 “You know I blamed Craig for not letting me do things? You know how stupid I feel about that
now? Maybe he didn’t really encourage me to do things, but he didn’t prevent me from doing them
either. But after a while, I didn’t do things because I didn’t want him to think different about me.
But the thing is, I wasn’t being honest. So, why would I care whether or not he loved me when he
didn’t really even know me?”
 I looked up at her. She had stopped crying.
 “So, tomorrow, I’m leaving. And I’m not going to let that happen again with anyone else. I’m
going to do what I want to do. I’m going to be who I really am. And I’m going to figure out what
that is. But right now I’m here with you. And I want to know where you are, what you need, and
what you want to do.”
 She waited patiently for my answer. But after everything she said, I figured that I should just
do what I wanted to do. Not think about it. Not say it out loud. And if she didn’t like it, then she
could just say so. And we could go back to packing.
 So, I kissed her. And she kissed me back. And we lay down on the floor and kept kissing. And
it was soft. And we made quiet noises. And kept silent. And still. We went over to the bed and lay
down on all the things that weren’t put in suitcases. And we touched each other from the waist up
over our clothes. And then under our clothes. And then without clothes. And it was so beautiful.
She was so beautiful. She took my hand and slid it under her pants. And I touched her. And I just
couldn’t believe it. It was like everything made sense. Until she moved her hand under my pants,
and she touched me.
115
 That’s when I stopped her.
 “What’s wrong?” she asked. “Did that hurt?”
 I shook my head. It felt good actually. I didn’t know what was wrong.
 “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to--”
 “No. Don’t be sorry,” I said.
 “But, I feel bad,” she said.
 “Please don’t feel bad. It was very nice,” I said. I was starting to get really upset.
 “You’re not ready?” she asked.
 I nodded. But that wasn’t it. I didn’t know what it was.
 “It’s okay that you’re not ready,” she said. She was being really nice to me, but I was just feeling
so bad.
 “Charlie, do you want to go home?” she asked.
 I guess I nodded because she helped me get dressed. And then she put on her shirt. And I
wanted to kick myself for being such a baby. Because I loved Sam. And we were together. And I
was ruining it. Just ruining it. Just terrible. I felt so terrible.
 She took me outside.
 “Do you need a ride?” she asked. I had my father’s car. I wasn’t drunk. She looked really worried.
 “No, thanks.”
 “Charlie, I’m not going to let you drive like this.”
 “I’m sorry. I’ll walk then,” I said.
 “It’s two o’clock in the morning. I’m driving you home.”
 She went to another room to get the car keys. I just stood in the entry hall. I felt like I wanted
to die.
 “You’re white as a sheet, Charlie. Do you need some water?”
 “No. I don’t know.” I started to cry really hard.
 “Here. Just lie down on the couch,” she said.
 She laid me down on the couch. She brought out a damp washcloth and put it on my forehead.
 “You can sleep here tonight. Okay?”
 “Okay.”
 “Just calm down. Take deep breaths.”
 I did what she told me. And just before I fell asleep, I said something.
 “I can’t do that anymore. I’m sorry,” I said.
 “It’s okay, Charlie. Just go to sleep,” Sam said.
116
 But I wasn’t talking to Sam anymore. I was talking to someone else.
 When I fell asleep, I had this dream. My brother and my sister and I were watching television
with my Aunt Helen. Everything was in slow motion. The sound was thick. And she was doing
what Sam was doing. That’s when I woke up. And I didn’t know what the hell was going on.
Sam and Patrick were standing over me. Patrick asked if I wanted some breakfast. I guess I nodded.
We went and ate. Sam still looked worried. Patrick looked normal. We had bacon and eggs
with their parents, and everyone made small talk. I don’t know why I’m telling you about bacon
and eggs. It’s not important. It’s not important at all. Mary Elizabeth and everyone came over,
and while Sam’s mom was busy checking everything twice, we all walked to the driveway. Sam and
Patrick’s parents got in the van. Patrick got in the driver’s side of Sam’s pickup truck, telling everyone
he’d see them in a couple of days. Then, Sam hugged and said good-bye to everyone. Since
she was coming back for a few days toward the end of the summer, it was more of a “see ya” than
a good-bye.
 I was last. Sam walked up and held me for a long time. Finally, she whispered in my ear. She
said a lot of wonderful things about how it was okay that I wasn’t ready last night and how she
would miss me and how she wanted me to take care of myself while she was gone.
 “You’re my best friend,” was all I could say in return.
 She smiled and kissed my cheek, and it was like for a moment, the bad part of last night disappeared.
But it still felt like a good-bye rather than a “see ya.” The thing was, I didn’t cry. I didn’t
know what I felt.
 Finally, Sam climbed into her pickup, and Patrick started it up. And a great song was playing.
And everyone smiled. Including me. But I wasn’t there anymore.
 It wasn’t until I couldn’t see the cars that I came back and things started feeling bad again. But
this time, they felt much worse. Mary Elizabeth and everyone were crying now, and they asked me
if I wanted to go to the Big Boy or something. I told them no. Thank you. I need to go home.
 “Are you okay, Charlie?” Mary Elizabeth asked. I guess I was starting to look bad again because
she looked worried.
 “I’m fine. I’m just tired,” I lied. I got in my dad’s car, and drove away. And I could hear all
these songs on the radio, but the radio wasn’t on. And when I got into the driveway, I think I forgot
to turn off the car. I just went to the couch in the family room where the TV is. And I could
see the TV shows, but the TV wasn’t on.
 I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s like all I can do is keep writing this gibberish to keep
from breaking apart. Sam’s gone. And Patrick won’t be home for a few days. And I just couldn’t
talk with Mary Elizabeth or anybody or my brother or anybody in my family. Except maybe my
aunt Helen. But she’s gone. And even if she were here, I don’t think I could talk to her either.
Because I’m starting to feel like what I dreamt about her last night was true. And my psychiatrist’s
questions weren’t weird after all.
 I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now. I know other people have it a lot worse. I do know
that, but it’s crashing in anyway, and I just can’t stop thinking that the little kid eating french fries
with his mom in the shopping mall is going to grow up and hit my sister. I’d do anything not to
117
think that. I know I’m thinking too fast again, and it’s all in my head like the trance, but it’s there,
and it won’t go away. I just keep seeing him, and he keeps hitting my sister, and he won’t stop, and
I want him to stop because he doesn’t mean it, but he just doesn’t listen, and I don’t know what to
do.
 I’m sorry, but I have to stop this letter now.
 But first, I want to thank you for being one of those people who listens and understands and
doesn’t try to sleep with people even though you could have. I really mean it, and I’m sorry I’ve
put you through this when you don’t even know who I am, and we’ve never met in person, and I
can’t tell you who I am because I promised to keep all those little secrets. I just don’t want you to
think that I picked your name out of the phone book. It would kill me if you thought that. So,
please believe me when I tell you that I felt terrible after Michael died, and I saw a girl in class,
who didn’t notice me, and she talked all about you to a friend of hers. And even though I didn’t
know you, I felt like I did because you sounded like such a good person. The kind of person who
wouldn’t mind receiving letters from a kid. The kind of person who would understand how they
were better than a diary because there is communion and a diary can be found. I just don’t want
you to worry about me, or think that you’ve met me, or waste your time anymore. I’m so sorry
that I wasted your time because you really do mean a lot to me and I hope you have a very nice life
because I really think you deserve it. I really do. I hope you do, too. Okay, then. Goodbye.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 Epilogue
 August 23, 1992 Dear friend,
 I’ve been in the hospital for the past two months. They just released me yesterday. The doctor
told me that my mother and father found me sitting on the couch in the family room. I was completely
naked, just watching the television, which wasn’t on. I wouldn’t speak or snap out of it, they
said. My father even slapped me to wake me up, and like I told you, he never hits. But it didn’t
work. So, they brought me to the hospital where I stayed when I was seven after my aunt Helen
died. They told me I didn’t speak or acknowledge anyone for a week. Not even Patrick, whom I
guess visited me during that time. It’s scary to think about.
 All I remember is putting the letter in the mailbox. The next thing I knew, I was sitting in a doctor’s
office. And I remembered my aunt Helen. And I started to cry. And the doctor, who turned
out to be a very nice woman, started asking me questions. Which I answered.
 I don’t really want to talk about the questions and the answers. But I kind of figured out that
everything I dreamt about my aunt Helen was true. And after a while, I realized that it happened
every Saturday when we would watch television.
 The first few weeks in the hospital were very hard.
 The hardest part was sitting in the doctor’s office when the doctor told my mom and dad what
118
had happened. I have never seen my mother cry so much. Or my father look so angry. Because
they didn’t know it was happening when it was.
 But the doctor has helped me work out a lot of things since then. About my aunt Helen. And
about my family. And friends. And me. There are a lot of stages to these kinds of things, and she
was really great through all of them.
 The thing that helped me the most, though, was the time I could have visitors. My family, including
my brother and sister, always came for those days until my brother had to go back to school
to play football. After that, my family came without my brother, and my brother sent me cards.
He even told me on his last card that he read my report on Walden and liked it a lot, which made
me feel really good. Just like the first time I saw Patrick. The best thing about Patrick is that even
when you’re in a hospital, he doesn’t change. He just cracks jokes to make you feel better instead
of asking you questions about feeling worse. He even brought me a letter from Sam, and Sam said
that she was coming back at the end of August, and if I got better by then, she and Patrick would
drive me through the tunnel. And this time, I could stand in the back of the pickup truck if I
wanted to. Things like that helped more than anything.
 The days when I received mail were good, too. My grandfather sent me a really nice letter. So
did my great aunt. So did my grandma and Great Uncle Phil. My Aunt Rebecca even sent me
flowers with a card that was signed by all my Ohio cousins. It was nice to know that they were
thinking about me just like it was nice the time Patrick brought Mary Elizabeth and Alice and Bob
and everyone for a visit. Including Peter and Craig. I guess they’re friends again. And I was glad
they were. Just like I was glad that Mary Elizabeth did most of the talking. Because it made things
feel more normal. Mary Elizabeth even stayed a little later than the others. I was so happy to have
a chance to talk with her alone before she left for Berkeley. Just like I was happy for Bill and his
girlfr when they came to see me two weeks ago. They’re getting married this November, and they
want me to go to their wedding. It’s nice to have things to look forward to.
 The time it started to feel like everything was going to be all right was the time when my sister
and brother stayed after my parents had left. This was some time in July. They asked me a lot of
questions about Aunt Helen because I guess nothing had ever happened to them. And my brother
looked really sad. And my sister looked really mad. It was at that time that things started to get
clearer because there was nobody to hate anymore after that.
 What I mean is that I looked at my brother and sister, and I thought that maybe someday they
would be an aunt and uncle, just like I would be an uncle. Just like my mother and Aunt Helen
were sisters.
 And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of
people for what they did or didn’t do or what they didn’t know. I don’t know. I guess there could
always be someone to blame. Maybe if my grandfather didn’t hit her, my mom wouldn’t be so
quiet. And maybe she wouldn’t have married my dad because he doesn’t hit. And maybe I would
never have been born. But I’m very glad to have been born, so I don’t know what to say about it
all especially since my mom seems happy with her life, and I don’t know what else there is to want.
 It’s like if I blamed my aunt Helen, I would have to blame her dad for hitting her and the friend
of the family that fooled around with her when she was little. And the person that fooled around
119
with him. And God for not stopping all this and things that are much worse. And I did do that for
a while, but then I just couldn’t anymore. Because it wasn’t going anywhere. Because it wasn’t the
point.
 I’m not the way I am because of what I dreamt and remembered about my aunt Helen. That’s
what I figured out when things got quiet. And I think that’s very important to know. It made
things feel clear and together. Don’t get me wrong. I know what happened was important. And
I needed to remember it. But it’s like when my doctor told me the story of these two brothers
whose dad was a bad alcoholic. One brother grew up to be a successful carpenter who never
drank. The other brother ended up being a drinker as bad as his dad was. When they asked the
first brother why he didn’t drink, he said that after he saw what it did to his father, he could never
bring himself to even try it. When they asked the other brother, he said that he guessed he learned
how to drink on his father’s knee. So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe
we’ll never know most of them. But even if we don’t have the power to choose where we come
from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel
okay about them.
 I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won’t tell them that people are starving in
China or anything like that because it wouldn’t change the fact that they were upset. And even if
somebody else has it much worse, that doesn’t really change the fact that you have what you have.
Good and bad. Just like what my sister said when I had been in the hospital for a while. She said
that she was really worried about going to college, and considering what I was going through, she
felt really dumb about it. But I don’t know why she would feel dumb. I’d be worried, too. And really,
I don’t think I have it any better or worse than she does. I don’t know. It’s just different. Maybe
it’s good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really
be there. Like Sam said. Because it’s okay to feel things. And be who you are about them.
 When I got released yesterday, my mom drove me home. It was in the afternoon, and she asked
me if I was hungry. And I said yes. Then, she asked me what I wanted, and I told her I wanted
to go to McDonald’s like we did when I was little and got sick and stayed home from school. So,
we went there. And it was so nice to be with my mom and eat french fries. And later that night to
be with my family at dinnertime and have things just be like they always were. That was the amazing
part. Things just keep going. We didn’t talk about anything heavy or light. We were just there
together. And that was enough.
 So, today my father went to work. And my mother took my sister and me out to take care of
last-minute things for my sister since she’s leaving for college in a few days. When we got back, I
called Patrick’s house because he said that Sam should be home by then. Sam answered the phone.
And it was so nice to hear her voice.
 Later, they came by in Sam’s pickup truck. And we went to the Big Boy just like we always did.
Sam told us about her life at school, which sounded very exciting. And I told her about my life in
the hospital, which didn’t. And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest. After we left, we got
in Sam’s pickup truck, and just like Sam promised, we drove to the tunnel.
 About half a mile from the tunnel, Sam stopped the car, and I climbed in back. Patrick played
the radio really loud so I could hear it, and as we were approaching the tunnel, I listened to the mu-
120
sic and thought about all the things that people have said to me over the past year. I thought about
Bill telling me I was special. And my sister saying she loved me. And my mom, too. And even my
dad and brother when I was in the hospital. I thought about Patrick calling me his friend. And I
thought about Sam telling me to do things. To really be there. And I just thought how great it was
to have friends and a family.
 As we went into the tunnel I didn’t hold up my arms like I was flying. I just let the wind rush
over my face. And I started crying and smiling at the same time. Because I couldn’t help feeling
just how much I loved my aunt Helen for buying me two presents. And how much I wanted the
present I bought my mom for my birthday to be really special. And how much I wanted my sister
and brother and Sam and Patrick and everyone else to be happy.
 But mostly, I was crying because I was suddenly very aware of the fact that it was me standing
up in that tunnel with the wind over my face. Not caring if I saw downtown. Not even thinking
about it. Because I was standing in the tunnel. And I was really there. And that was enough to
make me feel infinite.
 Tomorrow, I start my sophomore year of high school. And believe it or not, I’m really not that
afraid of going. I’m not sure if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be
too busy trying to “participate.”
 So, if this does end up being my last letter, please believe that things are good with me, and even
when they’re not, they will be soon enough.
 And I will believe the same about you.
 Love always,
 Charlie
 THE END

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close

WHAT THE?
What about a teakettle? What if the spout opened and closed when the steam came out, so
it would become a mouth, and it could whistle pretty melodies, or do Shakespeare, or just
crack up with me? I could invent a teakettle that reads in Dad's voice, so I could fall asleep,
or maybe a set of kettles that sings the chorus of 'Yellow Submarine', which is a song by
the Beatles, who I love, because entomology is one of my raisons d'etre, which is a French
expression that I know. Another good thing is that I could train my anus to talk when I
farted. If I wanted to be extremely hilarious, I'd train it to say, 'Wasn't me!' every time I
made an incredibly bad fart. And if I ever made an incredibly bad fart in the Hall of Mirrors,
which is in Versailles, which is outside of Paris, which is in France, obviously, my
anus would say, 'Ce n'etais pas moi!'
What about little microphones? What if everyone swallowed them, and they played the
sounds of our hearts through little speakers, which could be in the pouches of our overalls?
When you skateboarded down the street at night you could hear everyone's heartbeat,
and they could hear yours, sort of like sonar. One weird thing is, I wonder if everyone's
hearts would start to beat at the same time, like how women who live together have
their menstrual periods at the same time, which I know about, but don't really want to
know about. That would be so weird, except that the place in the hospital where babies are
born would sound like a crystal chandelier in a houseboat, because the babies wouldn't
have had time to match up their heartbeats yet. And at the finish line at the end of the
New York City Marathon it would sound like war.
And also, there are so many times when you need to make a quick escape, but humans
don't have their own wings, or not yet, anyway, so what about a birdseed shirt?
Anyway.
My first jujitsu class was three and a half months ago. Self-defense was something that I
was extremely curious about, for obvious reasons, and Mom thought it would be good for
me to have a physical activity besides tambourining, so my first jujitsu class was three and
a half months ago. There were fourteen kids in the class, and we all had on neat white
robes. We practiced bowing, and then we were all sitting down Native American style,
and then Sensei Mark asked me to go over to him. 'Kick my privates,' he told me. That
made me feel self-conscious. 'Excusez-moi?' I told him. He spread his legs and told me, 'I
want you to kick my privates as hard as you can.' He put his hands at his sides, and took a
breath in, and closed his eyes, and that's how I knew that actually he meant business.
'Jose,' I told him, and inside I was thinking, What the?
He told me, 'Go on, guy. Destroy my privates.'
'Destroy your privates?' With his eyes still closed he cracked up a lot and said, 'You couldn't
destroy my privates if you tried. That's what's going on here. This is a demonstration of
the well-trained body's ability to absorb a direct blow. Now destroy my privates.' I told
him, 'I'm a pacifist,' and since most people my age don't know what that means, I turned
around and told the others, 'I don't think it's right to destroy people's privates. Ever.' Sensei
Mark said, 'Can I ask you something?' I turned back around and told him, 'Can I ask
3
you something?' is asking me something.' He said, 'Do you have dreams of becoming a jujitsu
master?'
'No,' I told him, even though I don't have dreams of running the family jewelry business
anymore. He said, 'Do you want to know how a jujitsu student becomes a jujitsu master?'
'I want to know everything,' I told him, but that isn't true anymore either. He told me, 'A
jujitsu student becomes a jujitsu master by destroying his master's privates.' I told him,
'That's fascinating.' My last jujitsu class was three and a half months ago.
I desperately wish I had my tambourine with me now, because even after everything I'm
still wearing heavy boots, and sometimes it helps to play a good beat. My most impressive
song that I can play on my tambourine is 'The Flight of the Bumblebee', by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov,
which is also the ring tone I downloaded for the cell phone I got after Dad
died. It's pretty amazing that I can play 'The Flight of the Bumblebee', because you have to
hit incredibly fast in parts, and that's extremely hard for me, because I don't really have
wrists yet. Ron offered to buy me a five-piece drum set. Money can't buy me love, obviously,
but I asked if it would have Zildjian cymbals. He said, 'Whatever you want,' and
then he took my yo-yo off my desk and started to walk the dog with it. I know he just
wanted to be friendly, but it made me incredibly angry. 'Yo-yo moi!' I told him, grabbing it
back. What I really wanted to tell him was 'You're not my dad, and you never will be.'
Isn't it so weird how the number of dead people is increasing even though the earth stays
the same size, so that one day there isn't going to be room to bury anyone anymore? For
my ninth birthday last year, Grandma gave me a subscription to National Geographic,
which she calls 'the National Geographic'. She also gave me a white blazer, because I only
wear white clothes, and it's too big to wear so it will last me a long time. She also gave me
Grandpa's camera, which I loved for two reasons. I asked why he didn't take it with him
when he left her. She said, 'Maybe he wanted you to have it.' I said, 'But I was negativethirty
years old.' She said, 'Still.' Anyway, the fascinating thing was that I read in National
Geographic that there are more people alive now than have died in all of human history. In
other words, if everyone wanted to play Hamlet at once, they couldn't, because there aren't
enough skulls!
So what about skyscrapers for dead people that were built down? They could be underneath
the skyscrapers for living people that are built up. You could bury people one hundred
floors down, and a whole dead world could be underneath the living one. Sometimes
I think it would be weird if there were a skyscraper that moved up and down while its
elevator stayed in place. So if you wanted to go to the ninety-fifth floor, you'd just press
the 95 button and the ninety-fifth floor would come to you. Also, that could be extremely
useful, because if you're on the ninety-fifth floor, and a plane hits below you, the building
could take you to the ground, and everyone could be safe, even if you left your birdseed
shirt at home that day.
I've only been in a limousine twice ever. The first time was terrible, even though the limousine
was wonderful. I'm not allowed to watch TV at home, and I'm not allowed to
watch TV in limousines either, but it was still neat that there was a TV there. I asked if we
could go by school, so Toothpaste and The Minch could see me in a limousine. Mom said
that school wasn't on the way, and we couldn't be late to the cemetery. 'Why not?' I asked,
4
which I actually thought was a good question, because if you think about it, why not?
Even though I'm not anymore, I used to be an atheist, which means I didn't believe in
things that couldn't be observed. I believed that once you're dead, you're dead forever,
and you don't feel anything, and you don't even dream. It's not that I believe in things that
can't be observed now, because I don't. It's that I believe that things are extremely complicated.
And anyway, it's not like we were actually burying him, anyway.
Even though I was trying hard for it not to, it was annoying me how Grandma kept touching
me, so I climbed into the front seat and poked the driver's shoulder until he gave me
some attention. 'What. Is. Your. Designation.' I asked in Stephen Hawking voice. 'Say
what?'
'He wants to know your name,' Grandma said from the back seat. He handed me his card.
GERALD THOMPSON
Sunshine Limousine
serving the five boroughs
 (212)570-7249
I handed him my card and told him, 'Greetings. Gerald. I. Am. Oskar.' He asked me why I
was talking like that. I told him, 'Oskar's CPU is a neural-net processor. A learning computer.
The more contact he has with humans, the more he learns.' Gerald said, 'O' and then
he said 'K.' I couldn't tell if he liked me or not, so I told him, 'Your sunglasses are one hundred
dollars.' He said, 'One seventy-five.'
'Do you know a lot of curse words?'
'I know a couple.'
'I'm not allowed to use curse words.'
'Bummer.'
'What's 'bummer'?'
'It's a bad thing.'
'Do you know 'shit'?'
'That's a curse, isn't it?'
'Not if you say 'shiitake'.'
'Guess not.'
'Succotash my Balzac, dipshiitake.' Gerald shook his head and cracked up a little, but not
in the bad way, which is at me. 'I can't even say 'hair pie,' I told him, 'unless I'm talking
about an actual pie made out of rabbits. Cool driving gloves.'
'Thanks.' And then I thought of something, so I said it. 'Actually, if limousines were extremely
long, they wouldn't need drivers. You could just get in the back seat, walk through
the limousine, and then get out of the front seat, which would be where you wanted to go.
So in this situation, the front seat would be at the cemetery.'
'And I would be watching the game right now.' I patted his shoulder and told him, 'When
you lookup 'hilarious' in the dictionary, there's a picture of you.'
5
In the back seat, Mom was holding something in her purse. I could tell that she was
squeezing it, because I could see her arm muscles. Grandma was knitting white mittens, so
I knew they were for me, even though it wasn't cold out. I wanted to ask Mom what she
was squeezing and why she had to keep it hidden. I remember thinking that even if I were
suffering hypothermia, I would never, ever put on those mittens.
'Now that I'm thinking about it,' I told Gerald, 'they could make an incredibly long limousine
that had its back seat at your mom's VJ and its front seat at your mausoleum, and it
would be as long as your life.' Gerald said, 'Yeah, but if everyone lived like that, no one
would ever meet anyone, right?' I said, 'So?'
Mom squeezed, and Grandma knitted, and I told Gerald, 'I kicked a French chicken in the
stomach once,' because I wanted to make him crack up, because if I could make him crack
up, my boots could be a little lighter. He didn't say anything, probably because he didn't
hear me, so I said, 'I said I kicked a French chicken in the stomach once.'
'Huh?'
'It said, 'Oeuf.'
'What is that?'
'It's a joke. Do you want to hear another, or have you already had un oeuf?' He looked at
Grandma in the mirror and said, 'What's he saying?' She said, 'His grandfather loved animals
more than he loved people.' I said, 'Get it? Oeuf?'
I crawled back, because it's dangerous to drive and talk at the same time, especially on the
highway, which is what we were on. Grandma started touching me again, which was annoying,
even though I didn't want it to be. Mom said, 'Honey,' and I said, 'Oui,' and she
said, 'Did you give a copy of our apartment key to the mailman?' I thought it was so weird
that she would mention that then, because it didn't have to do with anything, but I think
she was looking for something to talk about that wasn't the obvious thing. I said, 'The
mailperson is a mailwoman.' She nodded, but not exactly at me, and she asked if I'd given
the mailwoman a key. I nodded yes, because I never used to lie to her before everything
happened. I didn't have a reason to. 'Why did you do that?' she asked. So I told her, 'Stan –
' And she said, 'Who?' And I said, 'Stan the doorman. Sometimes he runs around the corner
for coffee, and I want to be sure all of my packages get to me, so I thought, if Alicia – '
'Who?'
'The mail-woman. If she had a key, she could leave things inside our door.'
'But you can't give a key to a stranger.'
'Fortunately Alicia isn't a stranger.'
'We have lots of valuable things in our apartment.'
'I know. We have really great things.'
'Sometimes people who seem good end up being not as good as you might have hoped,
you know? What if she had stolen your things?'
'She wouldn't.'
'But what if?'
6
'But she wouldn't.'
'Well, did she give you a key to her apartment?' She was obviously mad at me, but I didn't
know why. I hadn't done anything wrong. Or if I had, I didn't know what it was. And I
definitely didn't mean to do it.
I moved over to Grandma's side of the limousine and told Mom, 'Why would I need a key
to her apartment?' She could tell that I was zipping up the sleeping bag of myself, and I
could tell that she didn't really love me. I knew the truth, which was that if she could have
chosen, it would have been my funeral we were driving to. I looked up at the limousine's
sunroof, and I imagined the world before there were ceilings, which made me wonder:
Does a cave have no ceiling, or is a cave all ceiling? 'Maybe you could check with me next
time, OK?'
'Don't be mad at me,' I said, and I reached over Grandma and opened and closed the
door's lock a couple of times. 'I'm not mad at you,' she said. 'Not even a little?'
'No.'
'Do you still love me?' It didn't seem like the perfect time to mention that I had already
made copies of the key for the deliverer from Pizza Hut, and the UPS person, and also the
nice guys from Greenpeace, so they could leave me articles on manatees and other animals
that are going extinct when Stan is getting coffee. 'I've never loved you more.'
'Mom?'
'Yes?'
'I have a question.'
'OK.'
'What are you squeezing in your purse?' She pulled out her hand and opened it, and it was
empty. 'Just squeezing,' she said.
Even though it was an incredibly sad day, she looked so, so beautiful. I kept trying to figure
out a way to tell her that, but all of the ways I thought of were weird and wrong. She
was wearing the bracelet that I made for her, and that made me feel like one hundred dollars.
I love making jewelry for her, because it makes her happy, and making her happy is
another one of my raisons d'etre.
It isn't anymore, but for a really long time it was my dream to take over the family jewelry
business. Dad constantly used to tell me I was too smart for retail. That never made sense
to me, because he was smarter than me, so if I was too smart for retail, then he really must
have been too smart for retail. I told him that. 'First of all,' he told me, 'I'm not smarter than
you, I'm more knowledgeable than you, and that's only because I'm older than you. Parents
are always more knowledgeable than their children, and children are always smarter
than their parents.'
'Unless the child is a mental retard,' I told him. He didn't have anything to say about that.
'You said 'first of all', so what's second of all?'
'Second of all, if I'm so smart, then why am I in retail?'
'That's true,' I said. And then I thought of something: 'But wait a minute, it won't be the
family jewelry business if no one in the family is running it.' He told me, 'Sure it will. It'll
7
just be someone else's family.' I asked, 'Well, what about our family? Will we open a new
business?' He said, 'We'll open something.' I thought about that my second time in a limousine,
when the renter and I were on our way to dig up Dad's empty coffin.
A great game that Dad and I would sometimes play on Sundays was Reconnaissance Expedition.
Sometimes the Reconnaissance Expeditions were extremely simple, like when he
told me to bring back something from every decade in the twentieth century – I was clever
and brought back a rock – and sometimes they were incredibly complicated and would go
on for a couple of weeks. For the last one we ever did, which never finished, he gave me a
map of Central Park. I said, 'And?' And he said, 'And what?' I said, 'What are the clues?'
He said, 'Who said there had to be clues?'
'There are always clues.'
'That doesn't, in itself, suggest anything.'
'Not a single clue?' He said, 'Unless no clues is a clue.'
'Is no clues a clue?' He shrugged his shoulders, like he had no idea what I was talking
about. I loved that.
I spent all day walking around the park, looking for something that might tell me something,
but the problem was that I didn't know what I was looking for. I went up to people
and asked if they knew anything that I should know, because sometimes Dad would design
Reconnaissance Expeditions so I would have to talk to people. But everyone I went
up to was just like, What the?
 I looked for clues around the reservoir. I read every poster on every lamppost and tree. I
inspected the descriptions of the animals at the zoo. I even made kite-fliers reel in their
kites so I could examine them, although I knew it was improbable. But that's how tricky
Dad could be. There was nothing, which would have been unfortunate, unless nothing
was a clue. Was nothing a clue?
That night we ordered General Tso's Gluten for dinner and I noticed that Dad was using a
fork, even though he was perfect with chopsticks. 'Wait a minute!' I said, and stood up. I
pointed at his fork. 'Is that fork a clue?' He shrugged his shoulders, which to me meant it
was a major clue. I thought: Fork, fork. I ran to my laboratory and got my metal detector
out of its box in the closet. Because I'm not allowed to be in the park alone at night,
Grandma went with me. I started at the Eighty-sixth Street entrance and walked in extremely
precise lines, like I was one of the Mexican guys who mow the lawn, so I wouldn't
miss anything. I knew the insects were loud because it was summer, but I didn't hear them
because my earphones covered my ears. It was just me and the metal underground.
Every time the beeps would get close together, I'd tell Grandma to shine the flashlight on
the spot. Then I'd put on my white gloves, take the hand shovel from my kit, and dig extremely
gently. When I saw something, I used a paintbrush to get rid of the dirt, just like a
real archeologist. Even though I only searched a small area of the park that night, I dug up
a quarter, and a handful of paper clips, and what I thought was the chain from a lamp that
you pull to make the light go on, and a refrigerator magnet for sushi, which I know about,
but wish I didn't. I put all of the evidence in a bag and marked on a map where I found it.
When I got home, I examined the evidence in my laboratory under my microscope, one
8
piece at a time: a bent spoon, some screws, a pair of rusty scissors, a toy car, a pen, a key
ring, broken glasses for someone with incredibly bad eyesÃ¢Â€Â¦ I brought them to Dad,
who was reading the New York Times at the kitchen table, marking the mistakes with his
red pen. 'Here's what I've found,' I said, pushing my pussy off the table with the tray of
evidence. Dad looked at it and nodded. I asked, 'So?' He shrugged his shoulders like he
had no idea what I was talking about, and he went back to the paper. 'Can't you even tell
me if I'm on the right track?' Buckminster purred, and Dad shrugged his shoulders again.
'But if you don't tell me anything, how can I ever be right?' He circled something in an article
and said, 'Another way of looking at it would be, how could you ever be wrong?'
He got up to get a drink of water, and I examined what he'd circled on the page, because
that's how tricky he could be. It was in an article about the girl who had disappeared, and
how everyone thought the congressman who was humping her had killed her. A few
months later they found her body in Rock Creek Park, which is in Washington, D.C., but
by then everything was different, and no one cared anymore, except for her parents.
 – statement, read to the hundreds of gathered press from a makeshift media center
off the back of the family home, Levy's father adamantly restated his confidence
that his daughter would be found. 'We will not stop looking until we are given a
definitive reason to stop looking, namely, Chandra's return.' During the brief question
and answer period that followed, a reporter from El Pais asked Mr. Levy if by
'return' he meant 'safe return.' Overcome with emotion, Mr. Levy was unable to
speak, and his lawyer took the microphone. 'We continue to hope and pray for
Chandra's safety, and will do everything within –
It wasn't a mistake! It was a message to me!
I went back to the park every night for the next three nights. I dug up a hair clip, and a roll
of pennies, and a thumbtack, and a coat hanger, and a 9V battery, and a Swiss Army knife,
and a tiny picture frame, and a tag for a dog named Turbo, and a square of aluminum foil,
and a ring, and a razor, and an extremely old pocket watch that was stopped at 5:37, although
I didn't know if it was A.M. or P.M. But I still couldn't figure out what it all meant.
The more I found, the less I understood.
I spread the map out on the dining room table, and I held down the corners with cans of
V8. The dots from where I'd found things looked like the stars in the universe. I connected
them, like an astrologer, and if you squinted your eyes like a Chinese person, it kind of
looked like the word 'fragile'. Fragile. What was fragile? Was Central Park fragile? Was nature
fragile? Were the things I found fragile? A thumbtack isn't fragile. Is a bent spoon
fragile? I erased, and connected the dots in a different way, to make 'door'. Fragile? Door?
Then I thought of porte, which is French for door, obviously. I erased and connected the
dots to make 'porte'. I had the revelation that I could connect the dots to make 'cyborg', and
'platypus', and 'boobs', and even 'Oskar', if you were extremely Chinese. I could connect
them to make almost anything I wanted, which meant I wasn't getting closer to anything.
And now I'll never know what I was supposed to find. And that's another reason I can't
sleep.
Anyway.
I'm not allowed to watch TV, although I am allowed to rent documentaries that are ap-
9
proved for me, and I can read anything I want. My favorite book is A Brief History of Time,
even though I haven't actually finished it, because the math is incredibly hard and Mom
isn't good at helping me. One of my favorite parts is the beginning of the first chapter,
where Stephen Hawking tells about a famous scientist who was giving a lecture about
how the earth orbits the sun, and the sun orbits the solar system, and whatever. Then a
woman in the back of the room raised her hand and said, 'What you have told us is rubbish.
The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.' So the scientist
asked her what the tortoise was standing on. And she said, 'But it's turtles all the way
down!'
I love that story, because it shows how ignorant people can be. And also because I love
tortoises.
A few weeks after the worst day, I started writing lots of letters. I don't know why, but it
was one of the only things that made my boots lighter. One weird thing is that instead of
using normal stamps, I used stamps from my collection, including valuable ones, which
sometimes made me wonder if what I was really doing was trying to get rid of things. The
first letter I wrote was to Stephen Hawking. I used a stamp of Alexander Graham Bell.
Dear Stephen Hawking,
Can I please be your protégé?
Thanks,
Oskar Schell
I thought he wasn't going to respond, because he was such an amazing person and I was
so normal. But then one day I came home from school and Stan handed me an envelope
and said, 'You've got mail!' in the AOL voice I taught him. I ran up the 105 stairs to our
apartment, and ran to my laboratory, and went into my closet, and turned on my flashlight,
and opened it. The letter inside was typed, obviously, because Stephen Hawking
can't use his hands, because he has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which I know about, unfortunately.

Thank you for your letter. Because of the large volume of mail I receive, I am unable
to write personal responses. Nevertheless, know that I read and save every letter, -
with the hope of one day being able to give each the proper response it deserves.
Until that day,
Most sincerely,
Stephen Hawking
I called Mom's cell. 'Oskar?'
'You picked up before it rang.'
'Is everything OK?'
'I'm gonna need a laminator.'
'A laminator?'
'There's something incredibly wonderful that I want to preserve.'
Dad always used to tuck me in, and he'd tell the greatest stories, and we'd read the New
10
York Times together, and sometimes he'd whistle 'I Am the Walrus', because that was his
favorite song, even though he couldn't explain what it meant, which frustrated me. One
thing that was so great was how he could find a mistake in every single article we looked
at. Sometimes they were grammar mistakes, sometimes they were mistakes with geography
or facts, and sometimes the article just didn't tell the whole story. I loved having a dad
who was smarter than the New York Times, and I loved how my cheek could feel the hairs
on his chest through his T-shirt, and how he always smelled like shaving, even at the end
of the day. Being with him made my brain quiet. I didn't have to invent a thing.
When Dad was tucking me in that night, the night before the worst day, I asked if the
world was a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.
'Excuse me?'
'It's just that why does the earth stay in place instead of falling through the universe?'
'Is this Oskar I'm tucking in? Has an alien stolen his brain for experimentation?' I said, 'We
don't believe in aliens.' He said, 'The earth does fall through the universe. You know that,
buddy. It's constantly falling toward the sun. That's what it means to orbit.' So I said, 'Obviously,
but why is there gravity?' He said, 'What do you mean why is there gravity?'
'What's the reason?'
'Who said there had to be a reason?'
'No one did, exactly.'
'My question was rhetorical.'
'What's that mean?'
'It means I wasn't asking it for an answer, but to make a point.'
'What point?'
'That there doesn't have to be a reason.'
'But if there isn't a reason, then why does the universe exist at all?'
'Because of sympathetic conditions.'
'So then why am I your son?'
'Because Mom and I made love, and one of my sperm fertilized one of her eggs.'
'Excuse me while I regurgitate.'
'Don't act your age.'
'Well, what I don't get is why do we exist? I don't mean how, but why.' I watched the fireflies
of his thoughts orbit his head. He said, 'We exist because we exist.'
'What the?'
'We could imagine all sorts of universes unlike this one, but this is the one that happened.'
I understood what he meant, and I didn't disagree with him, but I didn't agree with him
either. Just because you're an atheist, that doesn't mean you wouldn't love for things to
have reasons for why they are.
I turned on my shortwave radio, and with Dad's help I was able to pick up someone
speaking Greek, which was nice. We couldn't understand what he was saying, but we lay
11
there, looking at the glow-in-the-dark constellations on my ceiling, and listened for a
while. 'Your grandfather spoke Greek,' he said. 'You mean he speaks Greek,' I said. 'That's
right. He just doesn't speak it here.' 'Maybe that's him we're listening to.' The front page
was spread over us like a blanket. There was a picture of a tennis player on his back, who I
guess was the winner, but I couldn't really tell if he was happy or sad.
'Dad?'
'Yeah?'
'Could you tell me a story?'
'Sure.'
'A good one?'
'As opposed to all the boring ones I tell.'
'Right.' I tucked my body incredibly close into his, so my nose pushed into his armpit.
'And you won't interrupt me?'
'I'll try not to.'
'Because it makes it hard to tell a story.'
'And it's annoying.'
'And it's annoying.'
The moment before he started was my favorite moment.
'Once upon a time, New York City had a sixth borough.'
'What's a borough?'
'That's what I call an interruption.'
'I know, but the story won't make any sense to me if I don't know what a borough is.'
'It's like a neighborhood. Or a collection of neighborhoods.'
'So if there was once a sixth borough, then what are the five boroughs?'
'Manhattan, obviously, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx.'
'Have I ever been to any of the other boroughs?'
'Here we go.'
'I just want to know.'
'We went to the Bronx Zoo once, a few years ago. Remember that?'
'No.'
'And we've been to Brooklyn to see the roses at the Botanic Garden.'
'Have I been to Queens?'
'I don't think so.'
'Have I been to Staten Island?'
'No.'
'Was there really a sixth borough?'
'I've been trying to tell you.'
12
'No more interruptions. I promise.'
When the story finished, we turned the radio back on and found someone speaking
French. That was especially nice, because it reminded me of the vacation we just came
back from, which I wish never ended. After a while, Dad asked me if I was awake. I told
him no, because I knew that he didn't like to leave until I had fallen asleep, and I didn't
want him to be tired for work in the morning. He kissed my forehead and said good night,
and then he was at the door.
'Dad?'
'Yeah, buddy?'
'Nothing.'
The next time I heard his voice was when I came home from school the next day. We were
let out early, because of what happened. I wasn't even a little bit panicky, because both
Mom and Dad worked in midtown, and Grandma didn't work, obviously, so everyone I
loved was safe.
I know that it was 10:18 when I got home, because I look at my watch a lot. The apartment
was so empty and so quiet. As I walked to the kitchen, I invented a lever that could be on
the front door, which would trigger a huge spoked wheel in the living room to turn
against metal teeth that would hang down from the ceiling, so that it would play beautiful
music, like maybe 'Fixing a Hole' or 'I Want to Tell You', and the apartment would be one
huge music box.
After I petted Buckminster for a few seconds, to show him I loved him, I checked the
phone messages. I didn't have a cell phone yet, and when we were leaving school, Toothpaste
told me he'd call to let me know whether I was going to watch him attempt skateboarding
tricks in the park, or if we were going to go look at Playboy magazines in the
drugstore with the aisles where no one can see what you're looking at, which I didn't feel
like doing, but still.
Message one. Tuesday, 8:52 A.M.
Is anybody there? Hello? It's Dad. If you're there, pick up. I just tried the office, but
no one was picking up. Listen, something's happened. I'm OK. They're telling us to
stay in here we are and wait for the firemen. I'm sure it's fine. I'll give you another
call when I have a better idea of what's going on. Just wanted to let you know that
I'm OK, and not to worry. I'll call again soon.
There were four more messages from him: one at 9:12, one at 9:31, one at 9:46, and one at
10:04. I listened to them, and listened to them again, and then before I had time to figure
out what to do, or even what to think or feel, the phone started ringing.
It was 10:22:27.
I looked at the caller ID and saw that it was him.

WHY I'M NOT WHERE YOU ARE
 5/21/63
To my unborn child: I haven't always been silent, I used to talk and talk and talk and talk,
I couldn't keep my mouth shut, the silence overtook me like a cancer, it was one of my first
meals in America, I tried to tell the waiter, 'The way you just handed me that knife, that
reminds me of – ' but I couldn't finish the sentence, her name wouldn't come, I tried again,
it wouldn't come, she was locked inside me, how strange, I thought, how frustrating, how
pathetic, how sad, I took a pen from my pocket and wrote 'Anna' on my napkin, it happened
again two days later, and then again the following day, she was the only thing I
wanted to talk about, it kept happening, when I didn't have a pen, I'd write 'Anna' in the
air – backward and right to left – so that the person I was speaking with could see, and
when I was on the phone I'd dial the numbers – 2, 6, 6, 2 – so that the person could hear
what I couldn't, myself, say. 'And' was the next word I lost, probably because it was so
close to her name, what a simple word to say, what a profound word to lose, I had to say
'ampersand,' which sounded ridiculous, but there it is, 'I'd like a coffee ampersand something
sweet,' nobody would choose to be like that. 'Want' was a word I lost early on, which
is not to say that I stopped wanting things – I wanted things more – I just stopped being
able to express the want, so instead I said 'desire,' 'I desire two rolls,' I would tell the baker,
but that wasn't quite right, the meaning of my thoughts started to float away from me, like
leaves that fall from a tree into a river, I was the tree, the world was the river. I lost 'come'
one afternoon with the dogs in the park, I lost 'fine' as the barber turned me toward the
mirror, I lost 'shame' – the verb and the noun in the same moment; it was a shame. I lost
'carry', I lost the things I carried – 'daybook,' 'pencil,' 'pocket change,' 'wallet' – I even lost
'loss.' After a time, I had only a handful of words left, if someone did something nice for
me, I would tell him, 'The thing that comes before 'you're welcome,' if I was hungry, I'd
point at my stomach and say, 'I am the opposite of full,' I'd lost 'yes,' but I still had 'no,' so
if someone asked me, 'Are you Thomas?' I would answer, 'Not no,' but then I lost 'no,' I
went to a tattoo parlor and had YES written onto the palm of my left hand, and NO onto
my right palm, what can I say, it hasn't made life wonderful, it's made life possible, when I
rub my hands against each other in the middle of winter I am warming myself with the
friction of YES and NO, when I clap my hands I am showing my appreciation through the
uniting and parting of YES and NO, I signify 'book' by peeling open my clapped hands,
every book, for me, is the balance of YES and NO, even this one, my last one, especially
this one. Does it break my heart, of course, every moment of every day, into more pieces
than my heart was made of, I never thought of myself as quiet, much less silent, I never
thought about things at all, everything changed, the distance that wedged itself between
me and my happiness wasn't the world, it wasn't the bombs and burning buildings, it was
me, my thinking, the cancer of never letting go, is ignorance bliss, I don't know, but it's so
painful to think, and tell me, what did thinking ever do for me, to what great place did
thinking ever bring me? I think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness
one million times, but never once into it. 'I' was the last word I was able to speak aloud,
14
which is a terrible thing, but there it is, I would walk around the neighborhood saying, 'I I
I I.'
'You want a cup of coffee, Thomas?'
'I.'
'And maybe something sweet?'
'I.'
'How about this weather?'
'I.'
'You look upset. Is anything wrong?' I wanted to say, 'Of course,' I wanted to ask, 'Is anything
right?' I wanted to pull the thread, unravel the scarf of my silence and start again
from the beginning, but instead I said, 'I.' I know I'm not alone in this disease, you hear the
old people in the street and some of them are moaning, 'Ay yay yay,' but some of them are
clinging to their last word, 'I,' they're saying, because they're desperate, it's not a complaint,
it's a prayer, and then I lost 'I' and my silence was complete. I started carrying blank
books like this one around, which I would fill with all the things I couldn't say, that's how
it started, if I wanted two rolls of bread from the baker, I would write 'I want two rolls' on
the next blank page and show it to him, and if I needed help from someone, I'd write
'Help,' and if something made me want to laugh, I'd write 'Ha ha ha!' and instead of singing
in the shower I would write out the lyrics of my favorite songs, the ink would turn the
water blue or red or green, and the music would run down my legs, at the end of each day
I would take the book to bed with me and read through the pages of my life:
I want two rolls
And I wouldn't say no to something sweet
I'm sorry, this is the smallest I've got
Start spreading the news .
The regular, please
Thank you, but I'm about to burst
I'm not sure, but it's late
Help
Ha ha ha!
It wasn't unusual for me to run out of blank pages before the end of the day, so should I
have to say something to someone on the street or in the bakery or at the bus stop, the best
I could do was flip back through the daybook and find the most fitting page to recycle, if
someone asked me, 'How are you feeling?' it might be that my best response was to point
at, 'The regular, please,' or perhaps, 'And I wouldn't say no to something sweet,' when my
only friend, Mr. Richter, suggested, 'What if you tried to make a sculpture again? What's
the worst thing that could happen?' I shuffled halfway into the filled book: 'I'm not sure,
but it's late.' I went through hundreds of books, thousands of them, they were all over the
apartment, I used them as doorstops and paperweights, I stacked them if I needed to reach
something, I slid them under the legs of wobbly tables, I used them as trivets and coasters,
15
to line the birdcages and to swat insects from whom I begged forgiveness, I never thought
of my books as being special, only necessary, I might rip out a page – 'I'm sorry, this is the
smallest I've got' – to wipe up some mess, or empty a whole day to pack up the emergency
light bulbs, I remember spending an afternoon with Mr. Richter in the Central Park Zoo, I
went weighted down with food for the animals, only someone who'd never been an animal
would put up a sign saying not to feed them, Mr. Richter told a joke, I tossed hamburger
to the lions, he rattled the cages with his laughter, the animals went to the corners,
we laughed and laughed, together and separately, out loud and silently, we were determined
to ignore whatever needed to be ignored, to build a new world from nothing if
nothing in our world could be salvaged, it was one of the best days of my life, a day during
which I lived my life and didn't think about my life at all. Later that year, when snow
started to hide the front steps, when morning became evening as I sat on the sofa, buried
under everything I'd lost, I made a fire and used my laughter for kindling: 'Ha ha ha!'
'Ha ha ha!'
'Ha ha ha!'
'Ha ha ha!' I was already out of words when I met your mother, that may have been what
made our marriage possible, she never had to know me. We met at the Columbian Bakery
on Broadway, we'd both come to New York lonely, broken and confused, I was sitting in
the corner stirring cream into coffee, around and around like a little solar system, the place
was half empty but she slid right up next to me, 'You've lost everything,' she said, as if we
were sharing a secret, 'I can see.' If I'd been someone else in a different world I'd've done
something different, but I was myself, and the world was the world, so I was silent, 'It's
OK,' she whispered, her mouth too close to my ear, 'Me too. You can probably see it from
across a room. It's not like being Italian. We stick out like sore thumbs. Look at how they
look. Maybe they don't know that we've lost everything, but they know something's off.'
She was the tree and also the river flowing away from the tree, 'There are worse things,'
she said, 'worse than being like us. Look, at least we're alive,' I could see that she wanted
those last words back, but the current was too strong, 'And the weather is one hundred
dollars, also, don't let me forget to mention,' I stirred my coffee. 'But I hear it's supposed to
get crummy tonight. Or that's what the man on the radio said, anyway,' I shrugged, I didn't
know what 'crummy' meant, 'I was gonna go buy some tuna fish at the A&P. I clipped
some coupons from the Post this morning. They're five cans for the price of three. What a
deal! I don't even like tuna fish. It gives me stomachaches, to be frank. But you can't beat
that price,' she was trying to make me laugh, but I shrugged my shoulders and stirred my
coffee, 'I don't know anymore,' she said. 'The weather is one hundred dollars, and the man
on the radio says it's gonna get crummy tonight, so maybe I should go to the park instead,
even if I burn easily. And anyway, it's not like I'm gonna eat the tuna fish tonight, right?
Or ever, if I'm being frank. It gives me stomachaches, to be perfectly frank. So there's no
rush in that department. But the weather, now that won't stick around. Or at least it never
has. And I should tell you also that my doctor says getting out is good for me. My eyes are
crummy, and he says I don't get out nearly enough, and that if I got out a little more, if I
were a little less afraidÃ¢Â€Â¦' She was extending a hand that I didn't know how to take,
so I broke its fingers with my silence, she said, 'You don't want to talk to me, do you?' I
took my daybook out of my knapsack and found the next blank page, the second to last. 'I
16
don't speak,' I wrote. 'I'm sorry.' She looked at the piece of paper, then at me, then back at
the piece of paper, she covered her eyes with her hands and cried, tears seeped between
her fingers and collected in the little webs, she cried and cried and cried, there weren't any
napkins nearby, so I ripped the page from the book – 'I don't speak. I'm sorry.' – and used
it to dry her cheeks, my explanation and apology ran down her face like mascara, she took
my pen from me and wrote on the next blank page of my daybook, the final one:
Please marry me
I flipped back and pointed at, 'Ha ha ha!' She flipped forward and pointed at, 'Please
marry me.' I flipped back and pointed at, 'I'm sorry, this is the smallest I've got.' She
flipped forward and pointed at, 'Please marry me.' I flipped back and pointed at, 'I'm not
sure, but it's late.' She flipped forward and pointed at, 'Please marry me,' and this time put
her finger on 'Please,' as if to hold down the page and end the conversation, or as if she
were trying to push through the word and into what she really wanted to say. I thought
about life, about my life, the embarrassments, the little coincidences, the shadows of alarm
clocks on bedside tables. I thought about my small victories and everything I'd seen destroyed,
I'd swum through mink coats on my parents' bed while they hosted downstairs,
I'd lost the only person I could have spent my only life with, I'd left behind a thousand
tons of marble, I could have released sculptures, I could have released myself from the
marble of myself. I'd experienced joy, but not nearly enough, could there be enough? The
end of suffering does not justify the suffering, and so there is no end to suffering, what a
mess I am, I thought, what a fool, how foolish and narrow, how worthless, how pinched
and pathetic, how helpless. None of my pets know their own names, what kind of person
am I? I lifted her finger like a record needle and flipped back, one page at a time:

GOOGOLPLEX
 As for the bracelet Mom wore to the funeral, what I did was I converted Dad's last voice
message into Morse code, and I used sky-blue beads for silence, maroon beads for breaks
between letters, violet beads for breaks between words, and long and short pieces of string
between the beads for long and short beeps, which are actually called blips, I think, or
something. Dad would have known. It took me nine hours to make, and I had thought
about giving it to Sonny, the homeless person who I sometimes see standing outside the
Alliance FranÃƒÂ§oise, because he puts me in heavy boots, or maybe to Lindy, the neat
old woman who volunteers to give tours at the Museum of Natural History, so I could be
something special to her, or even just to someone in a wheelchair. But instead I gave it to
Mom. She said it was the best gift she'd ever received. I asked her if it was better than the
Edible Tsunami, from when I was interested in edible meteorological events. She said,
'Different.' I asked her if she was in love with Ron. She said, 'Ron is a great person,' which
17
was an answer to a question I didn't ask. So I asked again. 'True or false: you are in love
with Ron.' She put her hand with the ring on it in her hair and said, 'Oskar, Ron is my
friend.' I was going to ask her if she was humping her friend, and if she had said yes, I
would have run away, and if she had said no, I would have asked if they heavy-petted
each other, which I know about. I wanted to tell her she shouldn't be playing Scrabble yet.
Or looking in the mirror. Or turning the stereo any louder than what you needed just to
hear it. It wasn't fair to Dad, and it wasn't fair to me. But I buried it all inside me. I made
her other Morse code jewelry with Dad's messages – a necklace, an anklet, some dangly
earrings, a tiara – but the bracelet was definitely the most beautiful, probably because it
was the last, which made it the most precious.
'Mom?'
'Yes?'
'Nothing.'
Even after a year, I still had an extremely difficult time doing certain things, like taking
showers, for some reason, and getting into elevators, obviously. There was a lot of stuff
that made me panicky, like suspension bridges, germs, airplanes, fireworks, Arab people
on the subway (even though I'm not racist), Arab people in restaurants and coffee shops
and other public places, scaffolding, sewers and subway grates, bags without owners,
shoes, people with mustaches, smoke, knots, tall buildings, turbans. A lot of the time I'd
get that feeling like I was in the middle of a huge black ocean, or in deep space, but not in
the fascinating way. It's just that everything was incredibly far away from me. It was worst
at night. I started inventing things, and then I couldn't stop, like beavers, which I know
about. People think they cut down trees so they can build dams, but in reality it's because
their teeth never stop growing, and if they didn't constantly file them down by cutting
through all of those trees, their teeth would start to grow into their own faces, which
would kill them. That's how my brain was.
One night, after what felt like a googolplex inventions, I went to Dad's closet. We used to
Greco-Roman wrestle on the floor in there, and tell hilarious jokes, and once we hung a
pendulum from the ceiling and put a circle of dominoes on the floor to prove that the
earth rotated. But I hadn't gone back in since he died. Mom was with Ron in the living
room, listening to music too loud and playing board games. She wasn't missing Dad. I
held the doorknob for a while before I turned it.
Even though Dad's coffin was empty, his closet was full. And even after more than a year,
it still smelled like shaving. I touched all of his white T-shirts. I touched his fancy watch
that he never wore and the extra laces for his sneakers that would never run around the
reservoir again. I put my hands into the pockets of all of his jackets (I found a receipt for a
cab, a wrapper from a miniature Krackle, and the business card of a diamond supplier). I
put my feet into his slippers. I looked at myself in his metal shoehorn. The average person
falls asleep in seven minutes, but I couldn't sleep, not after hours, and it made my boots
lighter to be around his things, and to touch stuff that he had touched, and to make the
hangers hang a little straighter, even though I knew it didn't matter.
His tuxedo was over the chair he used to sit on when he tied his shoes, and I thought,
Weird. Why wasn't it hung up with his suits? Had he come from a fancy party the night
18
before he died? But then why would he have taken off his tuxedo without hanging it up?
Maybe it needed to be cleaned? But I didn't remember a fancy party. I remembered him
tucking me in, and us listening to a person speaking Greek on the shortwave radio, and
him telling me a story about New York's sixth borough. If I hadn't noticed anything else
weird, I wouldn't have thought about the tuxedo again. But I started noticing a lot.
There was a pretty blue vase on the highest shelf. What was a pretty blue vase doing way
up there? I couldn't reach it, obviously, so I moved over the chair with the tuxedo still on
it, and then I went to my room to get the Collected Shakespeare set that Grandma bought for
me when she found out that I was going to be Yorick, and I brought those over, four
tragedies at a time, until I had a stack that was tall enough. I stood on all of that and it
worked for a second. But then I had the tips of my fingers on the vase, and the tragedies
started to wobble, and the tuxedo was incredibly distracting, and the next thing was that
everything was on the floor, including me, and including the vase, which had shattered. 'I
didn't do it!' I hollered, but they didn't even hear me, because they were playing music too
loud and cracking up too much. I zipped myself all the way into the sleeping bag of myself,
not because I was hurt, and not because I had broken something, but because they
were cracking up. Even though I knew I shouldn't, I gave myself a bruise.
I started to clean everything up, and that was when I noticed something else weird. In the
middle of all of that glass was a little envelope, about the size of a wireless Internet card.
What the? I opened it up, and inside there was a key. What the, What the?
 It was a weird-looking key, obviously to something extremely important, because it was
fatter and shorter than a normal key. I couldn't explain it: a fat and short key, in a little envelope,
in a blue vase, on the highest shelf in his closet.
The first thing I did was the logical thing, which was to be very secretive and try the key in
all of the locks in the apartment. Even without trying I knew it wasn't for the front door,
because it didn't match up with the key that I wear on a string around my neck to let myself
in when nobody's home. I tiptoed so I wouldn't be noticed, and I tried the key in the
door to the bathroom, and the different bedroom doors, and the drawers in Mom's
dresser. I tried it in the desk in the kitchen where Dad used to pay the bills, and in the
closet next to the linen closet where I sometimes hid when we played hide and seek, and
in Mom's jewelry box. But it wasn't for any of them.
In bed that night I invented a special drain that would be underneath every pillow in New
York, and would connect to the reservoir. Whenever people cried themselves to sleep, the
tears would all go to the same place, and in the morning the weatherman could report if
the water level of the Reservoir of Tears had gone up or down, and you could know if
New York was in heavy boots. And when something really terrible happened – like a nuclear
bomb, or at least a biological weapons attack – an extremely loud siren would go off,
telling everyone to get to Central Park to put sandbags around the reservoir.
Anyway.
The next morning I told Mom that I couldn't go to school, because I was too sick. It was the
first lie that I had to tell. She put her hand on my forehead and said, 'You do feel a bit hot.'
I said, 'I took my temperature and it's one hundred point seven degrees.' That was the second
lie. She turned around and asked me to zip up the back of her dress, which she could
19
have done herself, but she knew that I loved to do it. She said, 'I'll be in and out of meetings
all day, but Grandma can come by if you need anything, and I'll call to check on you
every hour.' I told her, 'If I don't answer, I'm probably sleeping or going to the bathroom.'
She said, 'Answer.'
Once she left for work, I put on my clothes and went downstairs. Stan was sweeping up in
front of the building. I tried to get past him without him noticing, but he noticed. 'You
don't look sick,' he said, brushing a bunch of leaves into the street. I told him, 'I feel sick.'
He asked, 'Where's Mr. Feeling Sick going?' I told him, 'To the drugstore on Eighty-fourth
to get some cough drops.' Lie #3. Where I actually went was the locksmith's store, which is
Frazer and Sons, on Seventy-ninth.
'Need some more copies?' Walt asked. I gave him a high-five, and I showed him the key
that I had found, and asked him what he could tell me about it. 'It's for some kind of lockbox,'
he said, holding it up to his face and looking at it over his glasses. 'A safe, I'm guessing.
You can tell it's for a lockbox by its build.' He showed me a rack that had a ton of keys
on it. 'See, it's not like any of these. It's much thicker. Harder to break.' I touched all the
keys that I could reach, and that made me feel OK, for some reason. 'But it's not for a fixed
safe, I don't think. Nothing too big. Maybe something portable. Could be a safe-deposit
box, actually. An old one. Or some kind of fire-retardant cabinet.' That made me crack up
a little, even though I know there's nothing funny about being a mental retard. 'It's an old
key,' he said. 'Could be twenty, thirty years old.'
'How can you tell?'
'Keys are what I know.'
'You're cool.'
'And not many lockboxes use keys anymore.'
'They don't?'
'Well, hardly anyone uses keys anymore.'
'I use keys,' I told him, and I showed him my apartment key. 'I know you do,' he said. 'But
people like you are a dying breed. It's all electronic these days. Keypads. Thumbprint recognition.'

'That's so awesome.'
'I like keys.' I thought for a minute, and then I got heavy, heavy boots. 'Well, if people like
me are a dying breed, then what's going to happen to your business?'
'We'll become specialized,' he said, 'like a typewriter shop. We're useful now, but soon
we'll be interesting.'
'Maybe you need a new business.'
'I like this business.'
I said, 'I have a question that I was just wondering.' He said, 'Shoot.'
'Shoot?'
'Shoot. Go ahead. Ask.'
'Are you Frazer, or are you Son?'
20
'I'm Grandson, actually. My grandfather started the shop.'
'Cool.'
'But I suppose I'm also Son, since my dad ran things when he was alive. I guess I'm Frazer,
too, since my son works here during the summers.'
I said, 'I have another question.'
'Shoot.'
'Do you think I could find the company that made this key?'
'Anyone could've made it.'
'Well then, what I want to know is how can I find the lock that it opens?'
'I'm afraid I can't help you with that, any more than telling you to try it in every lock you
come across. I could always make you a copy, if you'd like.'
'I could have a googolplex keys.'
'Googolplex?'
'A googol to the googol power.'
'Googol?'
'That's a one with one hundred zeroes after it.' He put his hand on my shoulder and said,
'You need the lock.' I reached up real high and put my hand on his shoulder and said,
'Yeah.'
As I was leaving he asked, 'Shouldn't you be in school?' I thought fast and told him, 'It's
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.' Lie #4. 'I thought that was in January.'
'It used to be.' Lie #5.
When I got back to the apartment, Stan said, 'You've got mail!'
Dear Osk,
Hello, lad! Thanks for your glorious letter and the bulletproof drumsticks, which I
hope I'll never have to use! I have to confess, I've never thought too much about
giving lessonsÃ¢Â€Â¦
I hope you like the enclosed T-shirt, which I took the liberty of signing for you.
Your mate,
Ringo
I didn't like the enclosed T-shirt. I loved it! Although unfortunately it wasn't white, so I
couldn't wear it.
I laminated Ringo's letter and tacked it to my wall. Then I did some research on the Internet
about the locks of New York, and I found out a lot of useful information. For example,
there are 319 post offices and 207,352 post office boxes. Each box has a lock, obviously. I
also found out that there are about 70,571 hotel rooms, and most rooms have a main lock,
a bathroom lock, a closet lock, and a lock to the mini-bar. I didn't know what a mini-bar
was, so I called the Plaza Hotel, which I knew was a famous one, and asked. Then I knew
what a mini-bar was. There are more than 300,000 cars in New York, which doesn't even
count the 12,187 cabs and 4,425 buses. Also, I remembered from when I used to take the
21
subway that the conductors used keys to open and close the doors, so there were those,
too. More than 9 million people live in New York (a baby is born in New York every 50
seconds), and everyone has to live somewhere, and most apartments have two locks on
the front, and to at least some of the bathrooms, and maybe to some other rooms, and obviously
to dressers and jewelry boxes. Also there are offices, and art studios, and storage
facilities, and banks with safe-deposit boxes, and gates to yards, and parking lots. I figured
that if you included everything – from bicycle locks to roof latches to places for cufflinks –
there are probably about 18 locks for every person in New York City, which would mean
about 162 million locks, which is a crevasse-load of locks.
'Schell residenceÃ¢Â€Â¦Hi, MomÃ¢Â€Â¦A little bit, I guess, but still pretty
sickÃ¢Â€Â¦NoÃ¢Â€Â¦Uh-huhÃ¢Â€Â¦Uh-huhÃ¢Â€Â¦I guessÃ¢Â€Â¦I think I'll order
IndianÃ¢Â€Â¦But stillÃ¢Â€Â¦OK. Uh-huh. I willÃ¢Â€Â¦I knowÃ¢Â€Â¦I
knowÃ¢Â€Â¦Bye.'
I timed myself and it took me 3 seconds to open a lock. Then I figured out that if a baby is
born in New York every 50 seconds, and each person has 18 locks, a new lock is created in
New York every 2.777 seconds. So even if all I did was open locks, I'd still be falling behind
by .333 locks every second. And that's if I didn't have to travel from one lock to the
next, and if I didn't eat, and didn't sleep, which is an OK if, because I didn't actually sleep,
anyway. I needed a better plan.
That night, I put on my white gloves, went to the garbage can in Dad's closet, and opened
the bag that I'd thrown all of the pieces of the vase into. I was looking for clues that might
lead me in a direction. I had to be extremely careful so that I wouldn't contaminate the
evidence, or let Mom know what I was doing, or cut and infect myself, and I found the
envelope that the key was in. It was then that I noticed something that a good detective
would have noticed at the very beginning: the word 'Black' was written on the back of the
envelope. I was so mad at myself for not noticing it before that I gave myself a little bruise.
Dad's handwriting was weird. It looked sloppy, like he was writing in a hurry, or writing
down the word while he was on the phone, or just thinking about something else. So what
would he have been thinking about?
I Googled around and found out that Black wasn't the name of a company that made lockboxes.
I got a little disappointed, because it would have been a logical explanation, which
is always the best kind, although fortunately it isn't the only kind. Then I found out that
there was a place called Black in every state in the country, and actually in almost every
country in the world. In France, for example, there is a place called Noir. So that wasn't
very helpful. I did a few other searches, even though I knew they would only hurt me, because
I couldn't help it. I printed out some of the pictures I found – a shark attacking a girl,
someone walking on a tightrope between the Twin Towers, that actress getting a blowjob
from her normal boyfriend, a soldier getting his head cut off in Iraq, the place on the wall
where a famous stolen painting used to hang – and I put them in Stuff That Happened to Me,
my scrap-book of everything that happened to me.
The next morning I told Mom I couldn't go to school again. She asked what was wrong. I
told her, 'The same thing that's always wrong.'
'You're sick?'
22
'I'm sad.'
'About Dad?'
'About everything.' She sat down on the bed next to me, even though I knew she was in a
hurry. 'What's everything?' I started counting on my fingers: 'The meat and dairy products
in our refrigerator, fistfights, car accidents, Larry – '
'Who's Larry?'
'The homeless guy in front of the Museum of Natural History who always says 'I promise
it's for food' after he asks for money.' She turned around and I zipped her dress while I
kept counting. 'How you don't know who Larry is, even though you probably see him all
the time, how Buckminster just sleeps and eats and goes to the bathroom and has no raison
d'etre, the short ugly guy with no neck who takes tickets at the IMAX theater, how the sun
is going to explode one day, how every birthday I always get at least one thing I already
have, poor people who get fat because they eat junk food because it's cheaperÃ¢Â€Â¦'
That was when I ran out of fingers, but my list was just getting started, and I wanted it to
be long, because I knew she wouldn't leave while I was still going. 'Ã¢Â€Â¦domesticated
animals, how I have a domesticated animal, nightmares, Microsoft Windows, old people
who sit around all day because no one remembers to spend time with them and they're
embarrassed to ask people to spend time with them, secrets, dial phones, how Chinese
waitresses smile even when there's nothing funny or happy, and also how Chinese people
own Mexican restaurants but Mexican people never own Chinese restaurants, mirrors,
tape decks, my unpopularity at school, Grandma's coupons, storage facilities, people who
don't know what the Internet is, bad handwriting, beautiful songs, how there won't be
humans in fifty years – '
'Who said there won't be humans in fifty years?' I asked her, 'Are you an optimist or a pessimist?'
She looked at her watch and said, 'I'm optimistic.'
'Then I have some bad news for you, because humans are going to destroy each other as
soon as it becomes easy enough to, which will be very soon.'
'Why do beautiful songs make you sad?'
'Because they aren't true.'
'Never?'
'Nothing is beautiful and true.' She smiled, but in a way that wasn't just happy, and said,
'You sound just like Dad.'
'What do you mean I sound just like Dad?'
'He used to say things like that.'
'Like what?'
'Oh, like nothing is so-and-so. Or everything is so-and-so. Or obviously.' She laughed.
'He was always very definitive.'
'What's 'definitive'?'
'It means certain. It comes from 'definite.'
'What's wrong with definitivety?'
23
'Dad sometimes missed the forest for the trees.'
'What forest?'
'Nothing.'
'Mom?'
'Yes?'
'It doesn't make me feel good when you say that something I do reminds you of Dad.'
'Oh. I'm sorry. Do I do that a lot?'
'You do it all the time.'
'I can see why that wouldn't feel good.'
'And Grandma always says that things I do remind her of Grandpa. It makes me feel
weird, because they're gone. And it also makes me feel unspecial.'
'That's the last thing that either Grandma or I would want. You know you're the most special
thing to us, don't you?'
'I guess so.'
'The most.'
She petted my head for a while, and her fingers went behind my ear to that place that's
almost never touched.
I asked if I could zip her dress up again. She said, 'Sure,' and turned around. She said, 'I
think it would be good if you tried to go to school.' I said, 'I am trying.'
'Maybe if you just went for first period.'
'I can't even get out of bed.' Lie #6. 'And Dr. Fein said I should listen to my feelings. He
said I should give myself a break sometimes.' That wasn't a lie, exactly, although it wasn't
exactly the truth, either. 'I just don't want it to become a habit,' she said. 'It won't,' I said.
When she put her hand on the covers, she must have felt how puffy they were, because
she asked if I had my clothes on in bed. I told her, 'I do, and the reason is because I am
cold.' #7. 'I mean, in addition to being hot.'
As soon as she left, I got my things together and went downstairs. 'You look better than
yesterday,' Stan said. I told him to mind his own business. He said, 'Jeez.' I told him, 'It's
just that I'm feeling worse than yesterday.'
I walked over to the art supply store on Ninety-third Street, and I asked the woman at the
door if I could speak to the manager, which is something Dad used to do when he had an
important question. 'What can I do for you?' she asked. 'I need the manager,' I said. She
said, 'I know. What can I do for you?'
'You're incredibly beautiful,' I told her, because she was fat, so I thought it would be an
especially nice compliment, and also make her like me again, even though I was sexist.
'Thanks,' she said. I told her, 'You could be a movie star.' She shook her head, like, What
the? 'Anyway,' I said, and I showed her the envelope, and explained how I had found the
key, and how I was trying to find the lock it opened, and how maybe black meant something.
I wanted to know what she could tell me about black, since she was probably an expert
of color. 'Well,' she said, 'I don't know that I'm an expert of anything. But one thing I
24
can say is it's sort of interesting that the person wrote the word 'black' in red pen.' I asked
why that was interesting, because I just thought it was one of the red pens Dad used when
he read the New York Times.
'Come here,' she said, and she led me to a display of ten pens. 'Look at this.' She showed
me a pad of paper that was next to the display.
'See,' she said, 'most people write the name of the color of the pen they're writing with.'
'Why?'
'I don't know why. It's just one of those psychological things, I guess.'
'Psychological is mental?'
'Basically.' I thought about it, and I had the revelation that if I was testing out a blue pen,
I'd probably write the word 'blue.'
'It's not easy to do what your dad did, writing the name of one color with another color. It
doesn't come naturally.'
'Really?'
'This is even harder,' she said, and she wrote something on the next piece of paper and
told me to read it out loud. She was right, it didn't feel natural at all, because part of me
wanted to say the name of the color, and part of me wanted to say what was written. In
the end I didn't say anything.
I asked her what she thought it meant. 'Well,' she said, 'I don't know that it means
 anything. But look, when someone tests a pen, usually he either writes the name of the
color he's writing with, or his name. So the fact that 'Black' is written in red makes me
think that Black is someone's name.'
'Or her name.'
'And I'll tell you something else.'
'Yeah?'
'The b is capitalized. You wouldn't usually capitalize the first letter of a color.'
'Jose!'
'Excuse me?'
'Black was written by Black!'
'What?'
'Black was written by Black! I need to find Black!' She said, 'If there's anything else I can
help you with, just let me know.'
'I love you.'
'Would you mind not shaking the tambourine in the store?'
She walked away, and I stayed there for a bit, trying to catch up with my brain. I flipped
back through the pad of paper while I thought about what Stephen Hawking would do
next.
I ripped the last sheet from the pad and ran to find the manager again. She was helping
somebody with paintbrushes, but I thought it wouldn't be rude to interrupt her. 'That's my
25
dad!' I told her, putting my finger on his name. 'Thomas Schell!'
'What a coincidence,' she said. I told her, 'The only thing is, he didn't buy art supplies.' She
said, 'Maybe he bought art supplies and you didn't know it.'
'Maybe he just needed a pen.' I ran around the rest of the store, from display to display,
looking to see if he'd tested any other art supplies. That way I could prove if he had been
buying art supplies or just testing out pens to buy a pen.
I couldn't believe what I found.
His name was everywhere. He'd tested out markers and oil sticks and colored pencils and
chalk and pens and pastels and watercolors. He'd even scratched his name into a piece of
moldable plastic, and I found a sculpting knife with yellow on its end, so I knew that was
what he did it with. It was as if he was planning on making the biggest art project in history.
But I didn't get it: that had to have been more than a year ago.
I found the manager again. 'You said if there was anything else you could help me with,
that I should just let you know.' She said, 'Let me finish with this customer, and then you'll
have my full attention.' I stood there while she finished with the customer. She turned to
me. I said, 'You said if there was anything else you could help me with, that I should just
let you know. Well, I need to see all of the store's receipts.'
'Why?'
'So I can know what day my dad was here and also what he bought.'
'Why?'
'So I can know.'
'But why?'
'Your dad didn't die, so I won't be able to explain it to you.' She said, 'Your dad died?' I
told her yes. I told her, 'I bruise easily.' She went over to one of the registers, which was
actually a computer, and typed something on the screen with her finger. 'How do you
spell the name again?'
'S. C. H. E. L. L.' She pressed some more buttons, and made a face, and said, 'Nothing.'
'Nothing?'
'Either he didn't buy anything or he paid cash.'
'Shiitake, hold on.'
'Excuse me?'
'Oskar SchellÃ¢Â€Â¦Hi, MomÃ¢Â€Â¦Because I'm in the bathroomÃ¢Â€Â¦Because it
was in my pocketÃ¢Â€Â¦Uh-huh. Uh-huh. A little, but can I call you back when I'm not
going to the bathroom? Like in half an hour?Ã¢Â€Â¦That's personalÃ¢Â€Â¦I
guessÃ¢Â€Â¦Uh-huhÃ¢Â€Â¦Uh-huhÃ¢Â€Â¦OK, MomÃ¢Â€Â¦YuhÃ¢Â€Â¦Bye.'
'Well then, I have another question.'
'You're saying that to me or to the phone?'
'You. How long have those pads been by the displays?'
'I don't know.'
26
'He died more than a year ago. That would be a long time, right?'
'They couldn't have been out there that long.'
'You're sure?'
'Pretty sure.'
'Are you more or less than seventy-five-percent sure?'
'More.'
'Ninety-nine percent?'
'Less.'
'Ninety percent?'
'About that.' I concentrated for a few seconds. 'That's a lot of percent.'
I ran home and did some more research, and I found 472 people with the name Black in
New York. There were 216 different addresses, because some of the Blacks lived together,
obviously. I calculated that if I went to two every Saturday, which seemed possible, plus
holidays, minus Hamlet rehearsals and other stuff, like mineral and coin conventions, it
would take me about three years to go through all of them. But I couldn't survive three
years without knowing. I wrote a letter.
Cher Marcel,
Allo. I am Oskar's mom. I have thought about it a lot, and I have decided that it isn't
obvious why Oskar should go to French lessons, so he will no longer be going to go
to see you on Sundays like he used to. I want to thank you very much for everything
you have taught Oskar, particularly the conditional tense, which is weird.
Obviously, there's no need to call me when Oskar doesn't come to his lessons, because
I already know, because this was my decision. Also, I will keep sending you
checks, because you are a nice guy.
Votre amie dévouée,
Mademoiselle Schell
That was my great plan. I would spend my Saturdays and Sundays finding all of the people
named Black and learning what they knew about the key in the vase in Dad's closet. In
a year and a half I would know everything. Or at least know that I had to come up with a
new plan.
Of course I wanted to talk to Mom that night I decided to go hunting for the lock, but I
couldn't. It's not that I thought I would get in trouble for snooping around, or that I was
afraid she'd be angry about the vase, or even that I was angry at her for spending so much
time laughing with Ron when she should have been adding to the Reservoir of Tears. I
can't explain why, but I was sure that she didn't know about the vase, the envelope, or the
key. The lock was between me and Dad.
So for those eight months when I went looking around New York, and she would ask
where I was going and when I'd be back, I would just say, 'I'm going out. I'll be back later.'
What was so weird, and what I should have tried harder to understand, was that she
never asked anything else, not even 'Out where?' or 'Later when?' even though she was
27
normally so cautious about me, especially since Dad died. (She had bought me the cell
phone so we could always find each other, and had told me to take cabs instead of the
subway. She had even taken me to the police station to be fingerprinted, which was great.)
So why was she suddenly starting to forget about me? Every time I left our apartment to
go searching for the lock, I became a little lighter, because I was getting closer to Dad. But I
also became a little heavier, because I was getting farther from Mom.
In bed that night, I couldn't stop thinking about the key, and how every 2.777 seconds another
lock was born in New York. I pulled Stuff That Happened to Me from the space between
the bed and the wall, and I flipped through it for a while, wishing that I would finally
fall asleep.
After forever, I got out of bed and went to the closet where I kept the phone. I hadn't taken
it out since the worst day. It just wasn't possible.
A lot of the time I think about those four and a half minutes between when I came home
and when Dad called. Stan touched my face, which he never did. I took the elevator for the
last time. I opened the apartment door, put down my bag, and took off my shoes, like everything
was wonderful, because I didn't know that in reality everything was actually horrible,
because how could I? I petted Buckminster to show him I loved him. I went to the
phone to check the messages, and listened to them one after another.
Message one: 8:52 A.M.
Message two: 9:12 A.M.
Message three: 9:31 A.M.
Message four: 9:46 A.M.
Message five: 10:04 A.M.
I thought about calling Mom. I thought about grabbing my walkie-talkie and paging
Grandma. I went back to the first message and listened to them all again. I looked at my
watch. It was 10:22:21. I thought about running away and never talking to anyone again. I
thought about hiding under my bed. I thought about rushing downtown to see if I could
somehow rescue him myself. And then the phone rang. I looked at my watch. It was
10:22:27.
I knew I could never let Mom hear the messages, because protecting her is one of my most
important raisons d'etre, so what I did was I took Dad's emergency money from on top of
his dresser, and I went to the Radio Shack on Amsterdam. It was on a TV there that I saw
that the first building had fallen. I bought the exact same phone and ran home and recorded
our greeting from the first phone onto it. I wrapped up the old phone in the scarf
that Grandma was never able to finish because of my privacy, and I put that in a grocery
bag, and I put that in a box, and I put that in another box, and I put that under a bunch of
stuff in my closet, like my jewelry workbench and albums of foreign currencies.
That night when I decided that finding the lock was my ultimate raison d'etre – the raison
that was the master over all other raisons – I really needed to hear him.
I was extremely careful not to make any noise as I took the phone out of all of its protections.
Even though the volume was way down, so Dad's voice wouldn't wake Mom, he
still filled the room, like how a light fills a room even when it's dim.
28
Message two. 9:12 A.M.
It's me again. Are you there? Hello? Sorry if. It's getting a bit. Smoky. I was hoping
you would. Be. Home. I don't know if you've heard about what's happened. But. I.
Just wanted you to know that I'm OK. Everything. Is. Fine. When you get this, give
Grandma a call. Let her know that I'm OK. I'll call again in a few minutes. Hopefully
the firemen will be up here by then. I'll call.
I wrapped the phone back up in the unfinished scarf, and put that back in the bag, and put
that back in the box, and that in the other box, and all of that in the closet under lots of
junk.
I stared at the fake stars forever.
I invented.
I gave myself a bruise.
I invented.
I got out of bed, went over to the window, and picked up the walkie-talkie. 'Grandma?
Grandma, do you read me? Grandma? Grandma?'
'Oskar?'
'I'm OK. Over.'
'It's late. What's happened? Over.'
'Did I wake you up? Over.'
'No. Over.'
'What were you doing? Over.'
'I was talking to the renter. Over.'
'He's still awake? Over.' Mom told me not to ask questions about the renter, but a lot of the
time I couldn't help it. 'Yeah,' Grandma said, 'but he just left. He had to go run some errands.
Over.'
'But it's 4:12 A.M.? Over.'
The renter had been living with Grandma since Dad died, and even though I was at her
apartment basically every day, I still hadn't met him. He was constantly running errands,
or taking a nap, or in the shower, even when I didn't hear any water. Mom told me, 'It
probably gets pretty lonely to be Grandma, don't you think?' I told her, 'It probably gets
pretty lonely to be anyone.'
'But she doesn't have a mom, or friends like Daniel and Jake, or even a Buckminster.'
'That's true.'
'Maybe she needs an imaginary friend.'
'But I'm real,' I said. 'Yes, and she loves spending time with you. But you have school to go
to, and friends to hang out with, and Hamlet rehearsals, and hobby shops – '
'Please don't call them hobby shops.'
'I just mean you can't be around all the time. And maybe she wants a friend her own age.'
'How do you know her imaginary friend is old?'
29
'I guess I don't.'
She said, 'There's nothing wrong with someone needing a friend.'
'Are you actually talking about Ron now?'
'No. I'm talking about Grandma.'
'Except actually you're talking about Ron.'
'No, Oskar. I'm not. And I don't appreciate that tone.'
'I wasn't using a tone.'
'You were using your accusatory tone.'
'I don't even know what 'accusatory' means, so how could that be my tone?'
'You were trying to make me feel badly for having a friend.'
'No I wasn't.' She put her hand with the ring on it in her hair and said, 'You know, I actually
was talking about Grandma, Oskar, but it's true, I need friends, too. What's wrong
with that?' I shrugged my shoulders. 'Don't you think Dad would want me to have
friends?'
'I wasn't using a tone.'
Grandma lives in the building across the street. We're on the fifth floor and she's on the
third, but you can't really tell the difference. Sometimes she'll write notes for me on her
window, which I can see through my binoculars, and once Dad and I spent a whole afternoon
trying to design a paper airplane that we could throw from our apartment into hers.
Stan stood in the street, collecting all of the failed attempts. I remember one of the notes
she wrote right after Dad died was 'Don't go away.'
Grandma leaned her head out the window and put her mouth incredibly close to the
walkie-talkie, which made her voice sound fuzzy. 'Is everything OK? Over?'
'Grandma? Over.'
'Yes? Over.'
'Why are matches so short? Over.'
'What do you mean? Over.'
'Well, they always seem to run out. Everyone's always rushing at the end, and sometimes
even burning their fingers. Over.'
'I'm not very smart,' she said, insulting herself like she always does before she gives an
opinion, 'but I think the matches are short so they can fit in your pocket. Over.'
'Yeah,' I said, balancing my chin on my hand, and my elbow on the windowsill. 'I think
that, too. So what if pockets were a lot bigger? Over.'
'Well, what do I know, but I think the people might have a hard time reaching the bottoms
of them if they went much lower. Over.'
'Right,' I said, switching hands, because that one was getting tired, 'so what about a portable
pocket? Over.'
'A portable pocket? Over.'
'Yeah. It would be sort of like a sock, but with a Velcro outside, so you could attach it to
30
anything. It's not quite a bag, because it actually becomes part of what you're wearing, but
it's not quite a pocket either, because it's on the outside of your clothes, and also you can
remove it, which would have all sorts of advantages, like how you could move things
from one outfit to another easily, and how you could carry bigger things around, since you
can take the pocket off and reach your arm all the way in. Over.' She put her hand against
the part of her nightgown that covered her heart and said, 'That sounds like one hundred
dollars. Over.'
'A portable pocket would prevent a lot of finger burns from short matches,' I said, 'but also
a lot of dry lips from short ChapSticks. And why are candy bars so short, anyway? I mean,
have you ever finished a candy bar and not wanted more? Over.'
'I can't eat chocolate,' she said, 'but I understand what you're telling me. Over.'
'You could have longer combs, so your part could be all the way straight, and bigger mencils
– '
'Mencils?'
'Pencils for men.'
'Yes, yes.'
'And bigger mencils that are easier to hold, in case your fingers are fat, like mine, and you
could probably even train the birds that save you to take shiitakes in the portable pocket –
'
'I don't understand.'
'On your birdseed shirt.'
'Oskar? Over.'
'I'm OK. Over.'
'What's wrong, darling? Over.'
'What do you mean what's wrong? Over.'
'What's wrong? Over.'
'I miss Dad. Over.'
'I miss him, too. Over.'
'I miss him a lot. Over.'
'So do I. Over.'
'All the time. Over.'
'All the time. Over.' I couldn't explain to her that I missed him more, more than she or anyone
else missed him, because I couldn't tell her about what happened with the phone. That
secret was a hole in the middle of me that every happy thing fell into. 'Did I ever tell you
about how Grandpa would stop and pet every animal he saw, even if he was in a rush?
Over?'
'You've told me a googolplex times. Over.'
'Oh. And what about how his hands were so rough and red from all of his sculptures that
sometimes I joked to him that it was really the sculptures that were sculpting his hands?
31
Over.'
'That, too. But you can tell me again if you want. Over.' She told me again.
An ambulance drove down the street between us, and I imagined who it was carrying, and
what had happened to him. Did he break an ankle attempting a hard trick on his skateboard?
Or maybe he was dying from third-degree burns on ninety percent of his body?
Was there any chance that I knew him? Did anyone see the ambulance and wonder if it
was me inside?
What about a device that knew everyone you knew? So when an ambulance went down
the street, a big sign on the roof could flash
DON'T WORRY! DON'T WORRY!
 if the sick person's device didn't detect the device of someone he knew nearby. And if the
device did detect the device of someone he knew, the ambulance could flash the name of
the person in the ambulance, and either
IT'S NOTHING MAJOR! IT'S NOTHING MAJOR!
 or, if it was something major,
IT'S MAJOR! IT'S MAJOR!
 And maybe you could rate the people you knew by how much you loved them, so if the
device of the person in the ambulance detected the device of the person he loved the most,
or the person who loved him the most, and the person in the ambulance was really badly
hurt, and might even die, the ambulance could flash
GOODBYE! I LOVE YOU! GOODBYE! I LOVE YOU!
 One thing that's nice to think about is someone who was the first person on lots of people's
lists, so that when he was dying, and his ambulance went down the streets to the
hospital, the whole time it would flash
GOODBYE! I LOVE YOU! GOODBYE! I LOVE YOU!
'Grandma? Over?'
'Yes, darling? Over?'
'If Grandpa was so great, then why did he leave? Over.' She took a little step back so that
she disappeared into her apartment. 'He didn't want to leave. He had to leave. Over.'
'But why did he have to leave? Over.'
'I don't know. Over.'
'Doesn't that make you angry? Over.'
'That he left? Over.'
'That you don't know why. Over.'
'No. Over.'
'Sad? Over.'
'Sure. Over.'
'Hold on,' I said, and I ran back to my field kit and grabbed Grandpa's camera. I brought it
to the window and took a picture of her window. The flash lit up the street between us.

I could hear her kissing her fingers and then blowing.

I blew her a kiss back.

'Over and out,' one of us said.
1. Dad
We need much bigger pockets, I thought as I lay in bed, counting off the seven minutes
that it takes a normal person to fall asleep. We need enormous pockets, pockets big
enough for our families, and our friends, and even the people who aren't on our lists, people
we've never met but still want to protect. We need pockets for boroughs and for cities,
a pocket that could hold the universe.
Eight minutes thirty-two secondsÃ¢Â€Â¦
But I knew that there couldn't be pockets that enormous. In the end, everyone loses everyone.
There was no invention to get around that, and so I felt, that night, like the turtle that
everything else in the universe was on top of.
Twenty-one minutes eleven secondsÃ¢Â€Â¦
As for the key, I put it on the string next to my apartment key and wore it like a pendant.
As for me, I was awake for hours and hours. Buckminster curled up next to me, and I conjugated
for a while so I wouldn't have to think about things.
Je suis
Tu es
Il/elle est
Nous sommes
Vous etes
Ils/elles sont
Je suis
Tu es
Il/elle est Nous
I woke up once in the middle of the night, and Buckminster's paws were on my eyelids.

He must have been feeling my nightmares.
MY FEELINGS
 12 September 2003
Dear Oskar,
I am writing this to you from the airport.
I have so much to say to you. I want to begin at the beginning, because that is what you
deserve. I want to tell you everything, without leaving out a single detail. But where is the
beginning? And what is everything?
I am an old woman now, but once I was a girl. It's true. I was a girl like you are a boy. One
of my chores was to bring in the mail. One day there was a note addressed to our house.
There was no name on it. It was mine as much as anyone's, I thought. I opened it. Many
words had been removed from the text by a censor.
14 January 1921
To Whom Shall Receive This Letter:
My name is XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, and I am a XXXXXXXX in Turkish Labor
Camp XXXXX, Block XX. I know that I am lucky XX X XXXXXXX to be alive at all. I
have chosen to write to you without knowing who you are. My parents XXXXXXX
XXX. My brothers and sisters XXXXX XXXX, the main XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXX! I
have written XXX XX XXXXX XXXXXXX every day since I have been here. I trade
bread for postage, but have not yet received a response. Sometimes it comforts me
to think that they do not mail the letters we write.
XXX XX XXXXXX, or at least XXX XXXXXXXXX? XX XXXXX X XX throughout
XXXXX XX. XXX XXX XX XXXXX, and XXXXX XX XXXXX XX XXX, without once
XXX XX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXXX XXX XXXXX nightmare?
XXX XXX, XX XXXXX XX XXXXX XX! XXXXX XX XXX XX XXX XX XXXXXX to
write a few words to me I would appreciate it more than you ever could know.
Several of the XXXXXX XXXX received mail so I know that XX XX XXXXXXXX.
Please include a picture of yourself as well as your name. Include everything.
With great hopes,
Sincerely I am,
XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX
I took the letter straight to my room. I put it under my mattress. I never told my father or
mother about it. For weeks I was awake all night wondering. Why was this man sent to a
34
Turkish labor camp? Why had the letter come fifteen years after it had been written?
Where had it been for those fifteen years? Why hadn't anyone written back to him? The
others got mail, he said. Why had he sent a letter to our house? How did he know the
name of my street? How did he know of Dresden? Where did he learn German? What became
of him?
I tried to learn as much about the man as I could from the letter. The words were very
simple. Bread means only bread. Mail is mail. Great hopes are great hopes are great hopes.
I was left with the handwriting.
So I asked my father, your great-grandfather, whom I considered the best, most kindhearted
man I knew, to write a letter to me. I told him it didn't matter what he wrote
about. Just write, I said. Write anything.
Darling,
You asked me to write you a letter, so I am writing you a letter. I do not know why
I am writing this letter, or what this letter is supposed to be about, but I am writing
it nonetheless, because I love you very much and trust that you have some good
purpose for having me write this letter. I hope that one day you will have the experience
of doing something you do not understand for someone you love.
Your father
That letter is the only thing of my father's that I have left. Not even a picture.
Next I went to the penitentiary. My uncle was a guard there. I was able to get the handwriting
sample of a murderer. My uncle asked him to write an appeal for early release. It
was a terrible trick that we played on this man.
To the Prison Board:
My name is Kurt Schluter. I am Inmate 24922. I was put here in jail a few years ago.
I don't know how long it's been. We don't have calendars. I keep lines on the wall
with chalk. But when it rains, the rain comes through my window when I am sleeping.
And when I wake up the lines are gone. So I don't know how long it's been. I
murdered my brother. I beat his head in with a shovel. Then after I used that shovel
to bury him in the yard. The soil was red. Weeds came from the grass where his
body was. Sometimes at night I would get on my knees and pull them out, so no
one would know. I did a terrible thing. I believe in the afterlife. I know that you
can't take anything back. I wish that my days could be washed away like the chalk
lines of my days.
I have tried to become a good person. I help the other inmates with their chores. I
am patient now.
It might not matter to you, but my brother was having an affair with my wife. I
didn't kill my wife. I want to go back to her, because I forgive her.
If you release me I will be a good person, quiet, out of the way. Please consider my
appeal. Kurt Schluter, Inmate 24922
My uncle later told me that the inmate had been in prison for more than forty years. He
had gone in as a young man. When he wrote the letter to me he was old and broken. His
35
wife had remarried. She had children and grandchildren. Although he never said it, I
could tell that my uncle had befriended the inmate. He had also lost a wife, and was also
in a prison. He never said it, but I heard in his voice that he cared for the inmate. They
guarded each other. And when I asked my uncle, several years later, what became of the
inmate, my uncle told me that he was still there. He continued to write letters to the board.
He continued to blame himself and forgive his wife, not knowing that there was no one on
the other end. My uncle took each letter and promised the inmate that they would be delivered.
But instead he kept them all. They filled all of the drawers in his dresser. I remember
thinking it's enough to drive someone to kill himself. I was right. My uncle, your greatgreat-uncle,
killed himself. Of course it's possible that the inmate had nothing to do with
it. With those three samples I could make comparisons. I could at least see that the forced
laborer's handwriting was more like my father's than the murderer's. But I knew that I
would need more letters. As many as I could get.
So I went to my piano teacher. I always wanted to kiss him, but was afraid he would laugh
at me. I asked him to write a letter. And then I asked my mother's sister. She loved dance
but hated dancing.
I asked my schoolmate Mary to write a letter to me. She was funny and full of life. She
liked to run around her empty house without any clothes on, even once she was too old
for that. Nothing embarrassed her. I admired that so much, because everything embarrassed
me, and that hurt me. She loved to jump on her bed. She jumped on her bed for so
many years that one afternoon, while I watched her jump, the seams burst. Feathers filled
the small room. Our laughter kept the feathers in the air. I thought about birds. Could they
fly if there wasn't someone, somewhere, laughing?
I went to my grandmother, your great-great-grandmother, and asked her to write a letter.
She was my mother's mother. Your father's mother's mother's mother. I hardly knew her. I
didn't have any interest in knowing her. I have no need for the past, I thought, like a child.
I did not consider that the past might have a need for me. What kind of letter? my grandmother
asked. I told her to write whatever she wanted to write. You want a letter from
me? she asked. I told her yes. Oh, God bless you, she said.
The letter she gave me was sixty-seven pages long. It was the story of her life. She made
my request into her own. Listen to me. I learned so much. She sang in her youth. She had
been to America as a girl. I never knew that. She had fallen in love so many times that she
began to suspect she was not falling in love at all, but doing something much more ordinary.
I learned that she never learned to swim, and for that reason she always loved rivers
and lakes. She asked her father, my great-grandfather, your great-great-great-grandfather,
to buy her a dove. Instead he bought her a silk scarf. So she thought of the scarf as a dove.
She even convinced herself that it contained flight, but did not fly, because it did not want
to show anyone what it really was. That was how much she loved her father. The letter
was destroyed, but its final paragraph is inside of me. She wrote:
I wish I could be a girl again, with the chance to live my life again. I have suffered
so much more than I needed to. And the joys I have felt have not always been joyous.
I could have lived differently. When I was your age, my grandfather bought
me a ruby bracelet. It was too big for me and would slide up and down my arm. It
36
was almost a necklace. He later told me that he had asked the jeweler to make it
that way. Its size was supposed to be a symbol of his love. More rubies, more love.
But I could not wear it comfortably. I could not wear it at all. So here is the point of
everything I have been trying to say. If I were to give a bracelet to you, now, I
would measure your wrist twice.
With love,
Your grandmother
I had a letter from everyone I knew. I laid them out on my bedroom floor, and organized
them by what they shared. One hundred letters. I was always moving them around, trying
to make connections. I wanted to understand.
Seven years later, a childhood friend reappeared at the moment I most needed him. I had
been in America for only two months. An agency was supporting me, but soon I would
have to support myself. I did not know how to support myself. I read newspapers and
magazines all day long. I wanted to learn idioms. I wanted to become a real American.
Chew the fat. Blow off some steam. Close but no cigar. Rings a bell. I must have sounded
ridiculous. I only wanted to be natural. I gave up on that.
I had not seen him since I lost everything. I had not thought of him. He and my older sister,
Anna, were friends. I came upon them kissing one afternoon in the field behind the
shed behind our house. It made me so excited. I felt as if I were kissing someone. I had
never kissed anyone. I was more excited than if it had been me. Our house was small.
Anna and I shared a bed. That night I told her what I had seen. She made me promise
never to speak a word about it. I promised her.
She said, Why should I believe you?
I wanted to tell her, Because what I saw would no longer be mine if I talked about it. I
said, Because I am your sister. Thank you. Can I watch you kiss? Can you watch us kiss?
You could tell me where you are going to kiss, and I could hide and watch.
She laughed enough to migrate an entire flock of birds. That was how she said yes.
Sometimes it was in the field behind the shed behind our house. Sometimes it was behind
the brick wall in the schoolyard. It was always behind something.
I wondered if she told him. I wondered if she could feel me watching them, if that made it
more exciting for her. Why did I ask to watch? Why did she agree?
I had gone to him when I was trying to learn more about the forced laborer. I had gone to
everyone.
To Anna's sweet little sister,
Here is the letter you asked for. I am almost two meters in height. My eyes are
brown. I have been told that my hands are big. I want to be a sculptor, and I want to
marry your sister. Those are my only dreams. I could write more, but that is all that
matters.
Your friend,
Thomas
37
I walked into a bakery seven years later and there he was. He had dogs at his feet and a
bird in a cage beside him. The seven years were not seven years. They were not seven
hundred years. Their length could not be measured in years, just as an ocean could not explain
the distance we had traveled, just as the dead can never be counted. I wanted to run
away from him, and I wanted to go right up next to him. I went right up next to him. Are
you Thomas? I asked. He shook his head no. You are, I said. I know you are. He shook his
head no. From Dresden.
He opened his right hand, which had NO tattooed on it. I remember you. I used to watch
you kiss my sister. He took out a little book and wrote, I don't speak. I'm sorry. That made
me cry. He wiped away my tears. But he did not admit to being who he was. He never
did.
We spent the afternoon together. The whole time I wanted to touch him. I felt so deeply
for this person that I had not seen in so long. Seven years before, he had been a giant, and
now he seemed small. I wanted to give him the money that the agency had given me. I did
not need to tell him my story, but I needed to listen to his. I wanted to protect him, which I
was sure I could do, even if I could not protect myself.
I asked, Did you become a sculptor, like you dreamed? He showed me his right hand and
there was silence. We had everything to say to each other, but no ways to say it. He wrote,
Are you OK? I told him, My eyes are crummy. He wrote, But are you OK? I told him,
That's a very complicated question. He wrote, That's a very simple answer. I asked, Are
you OK?
He wrote, Some mornings I wake up feeling grateful. We talked for hours, but we just kept
repeating those same things over and over.
Our cups emptied. The day emptied.
I was more alone than if I had been alone. We were about to go in different directions. We
did not know how to do anything else. It's getting late, I said.
He showed me his left hand, which had YES tattooed on it. I said, I should probably go
home.
He flipped back through his book and pointed at, Are you OK? I nodded yes.
I started to walk off. I was going to walk to the Hudson River and keep walking. I would
carry the biggest stone I could bear and let my lungs fill with water.
But then I heard him clapping his hands behind me. I turned around and he motioned for
me to come to him. I wanted to run away from him, and I wanted to go to him. I went to
him.
He asked if I would pose for him. He wrote his question in German, and it wasn't until
then that I realized he had been writing in English all afternoon, and that I had been
speaking English. Yes, I said in German. Yes. We made arrangements for the next day. His
apartment was like a zoo. There were animals everywhere. Dogs and cats. A dozen birdcages.
Fish tanks. Glass boxes with snakes and lizards and insects. Mice in cages, so the
cats wouldn't get them. Like Noah's ark. But he kept one corner clean and bright. He said
he was saving the space. For what? For sculptures.
I wanted to know from what, or from whom, but I did not ask. He led me by the hand. We
38
talked for half an hour about what he wanted to make. I told him I would do whatever he
needed. We drank coffee.
He wrote that he had not made a sculpture in America. Why not?
I haven't been able to. Why not?
We never talked about the past. He opened the flue, although I didn't know why. Birds
sang in the other room. I took off my clothes. I went onto the couch.
He stared at me. It was the first time I had ever been naked in front of a man. I wondered
if he knew that.
He came over and moved my body like I was a doll. He put my hands behind my head.
He bent my right leg a little. I assumed his hands were so rough from all of the sculptures
he used to make. He lowered my chin. He turned my palms up. His attention filled the
hole in the middle of me.
I went back the next day. And the next day. I stopped looking for a job. All that mattered
was him looking at me. I was prepared to fall apart if it came to that. Each time it was the
same. He would talk about what he wanted to make. I would tell him I would do whatever
he needed. We would drink coffee. We would never talk about the past. He would
open the flue. The birds would sing in the other room. I would undress. He would position
me. He would sculpt me.
Sometimes I would think about those hundred letters laid across my bedroom floor. If I
hadn't collected them, would our house have burned less brightly?
I looked at the sculpture after every session. He went to feed the animals. He let me be
alone with it, although I never asked him for privacy. He understood.
After only a few sessions it became clear that he was sculpting Anna. He was trying to remake
the girl he knew seven years before. He looked at me as he sculpted, but he saw her.
The positioning took longer and longer. He touched more of me.
He moved me around more. He spent ten full minutes bending and unbending my knee.
He closed and unclosed my hands.
I hope this doesn't embarrass you, he wrote in German in his little book.
No, I said in German. No.
He folded one of my arms. He straightened one of my arms. The next week he touched my
hair for what might have been five or fifty minutes.
He wrote, I am looking for an acceptable compromise.
I wanted to know how he lived through that night.
He touched my breasts, easing them apart.
I think this will be good, he wrote.
I wanted to know what will be good. How will it be good?
He touched me all over. I can tell you these things because I am not ashamed of them, because
I learned from them. And I trust you to understand me. You are the only one I trust,
Oskar.
The positioning was the sculpting. He was sculpting me. He was trying to make me so he
39
could fall in love with me.
He spread my legs. His palms pressed gently at the insides of my thighs. My thighs
pressed back. His palms pressed out.
Birds were singing in the other room.
We were looking for an acceptable compromise.
The next week he held the backs of my legs, and the next week he was behind me. It was
the first time I had ever made love. I wondered if he knew that. It felt like crying. I wondered,
Why does anyone ever make love?
I looked at the unfinished sculpture of my sister, and the unfinished girl looked back at
me.
Why does anyone ever make love?
We walked together to the bakery where we first met.
Together and separately.
We sat at a table. On the same side, facing the windows.
I did not need to know if he could love me.
I needed to know if he could need me.
I flipped to the next blank page of his little book and wrote, Please marry me.
He looked at his hands.
YES and NO.
Why does anyone ever make love?
He took his pen and wrote on the next and last page, No children.
That was our first rule.
I understand, I told him in English.
We never used German again.
The next day, your grandfather and I were married.
THE ONLY ANIMAL
I read the first chapter of A Brief History of Time when Dad was still alive, and I got incredibly
heavy boots about how relatively insignificant life is, and how, compared to the
universe and compared to time, it didn't even matter if I existed at all. When Dad was
tucking me in that night and we were talking about the book, I asked if he could think of a
solution to that problem. 'Which problem?'
40
'The problem of how relatively insignificant we are.' He said, 'Well, what would happen if
a plane dropped you in the middle of the Sahara Desert and you picked up a single grain
of sand with tweezers and moved it one millimeter?' I said, 'I'd probably die of dehydration.'
He said, 'I just mean right then, when you moved that single grain of sand. What
would that mean?' I said, 'I dunno, what?' He said, 'Think about it.' I thought about it. 'I
guess I would have moved a grain of sand.'
'Which would mean?'
'Which would mean I moved a grain of sand?'
'Which would mean you changed the Sahara.'
'So?'
'So? So the Sahara is a vast desert. And it has existed for millions of years. And you
changed it!'
'That's true!' I said, sitting up. 'I changed the Sahara!'
'Which means?' he said. 'What? Tell me.'
'Well, I'm not talking about painting the Mona Lisa or curing cancer. I'm just talking about
moving that one grain of sand one millimeter.'
'Yeah?'
'If you hadn' done it, human history would have been one wayÃ¢Â€Â¦'
'Uh-huh?'
'But you did do it, soÃ¢Â€Â¦?' I stood on the bed, pointed my fingers at the fake stars, and
screamed: 'I changed the course of human history!'
'That's right.'
'I changed the universe!'
'You did.'
'I'm God!'
'You're an atheist.'
'I don't exist!' I fell back onto the bed, into his arms, and we cracked up together.
That was kind of how I felt when I decided that I would meet every person in New York
with the last name Black. Even if it was relatively insignificant, it was something, and I
needed to do something, like sharks, who die if they don't swim, which I know about.
Anyway.
I decided that I would go through the names alphabetically, from Aaron to Zyna, even
though it would have been a more efficient method to do it by geographical zones. Another
thing I decided was that I would be as secretive about my mission as I could at
home, and as honest about it as I could outside home, because that's what was necessary.
So if Mom asked me, 'Where are you going and when will you be back?' I would tell her,
'Out, later.' But if one of the Blacks wanted to know something, I would tell everything.
My other rules were that I wouldn't be sexist again, or racist, or ageist, or homophobic, or
overly wimpy, or discriminatory to handicapped people or mental retards, and also that I
41
wouldn't lie unless I absolutely had to, which I did a lot. I put together a special field kit
with some of the things I was going to need, like a Magnum flashlight, ChapStick, some
Fig Newtons, plastic bags for important evidence and litter, my cell phone, the script for
Hamlet (so I could memorize my stage directions while I was going from one place to another,
because I didn't have any lines to memorize), a topographical map of New York, iodine
pills in case of a dirty bomb, my white gloves, obviously, a couple of boxes of Juicy
Juice, a magnifying glass, my Larousse Pocket Dictionary, and a bunch of other useful stuff. I
was ready to go.
On my way out, Stan said, 'What a day!' I said, 'Yeah.' He asked, 'What's on the menu?' I
showed him the key. He said, 'Lox?' I said, 'Hilarious, but I don't eat anything with parents.'
He shook his head and said, 'I couldn't help myself. So what's on the menu?'
'Queens and Greenwich Village.'
'You mean Gren-ich Village?' That was my first disappointment of the expedition, because
I thought it was pronounced phonetically, which would have been a fascinating clue.
'Anyway.'
It took me three hours and forty-one minutes to walk to Aaron Black, because public
transportation makes me panicky, even though walking over bridges also makes me panicky.
Dad used to say that sometimes you have to put your fears in order, and that was
one of those times. I walked across Amsterdam Avenue, and Columbus Avenue, and Central
Park, and Fifth Avenue, and Madison Avenue, and Park Avenue, and Lexington Avenue,
and Third Avenue, and Second Avenue. When I was exactly halfway across the Fiftyninth
Street Bridge, I thought about how a millimeter behind me was Manhattan and a
millimeter in front of me was Queens. So what's the name of the parts of New York – exactly
halfway through the Midtown Tunnel, exactly halfway over the Brooklyn Bridge, the
exact middle of the Staten Island Ferry when it's exactly halfway between Manhattan and
Staten Island – that aren't in any borough?
I took a step forward, and it was my first time in Queens.
I walked through Long Island City, Woodside, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. I shook my
tambourine the whole time, because it helped me remember that even though I was going
through different neighborhoods, I was still me. When I finally got to the building, I
couldn't figure out where the doorman was. At first I thought maybe he was just getting
some coffee, but I waited around for a few minutes and he didn't come. I looked through
the door and saw that there was no desk for him. I thought, Weird.
I tried my key in the lock, but it didn't go in past the tip. I saw a device with a button for
each apartment, so I pressed the button for A. Black's apartment, which was 9E. No one
answered. I pressed it again. Nothing. I held down the buzzer for fifteen seconds. Still
nothing. I sat down on the ground and wondered if it would be overly wimpy to cry in the
lobby of an apartment building in Corona.
'All right, all right,' a voice said from the speaker. 'Take it easy.' I jumped up. 'Hello,' I said,
'my name is Oskar Schell.'
'What do you want?' His voice sounded mad, but I hadn't done anything wrong. 'Did you
know Thomas Schell?'
42
'No.'
'Are you sure?'
'Yes.'
'Do you know anything about a key?'
'What do you want?'
'I didn't do anything wrong.'
'What do you want?'
'I found a key,' I said, 'and it was in an envelope with your name on it.'
'Aaron Black?'
'No, just Black.'
'It's a common name.'
'I know.'
'And a color.'
'Obviously.'
'Goodbye,' the voice said. 'But I'm just trying to find out about this key.'
'Goodbye.'
'But – '
'Goodbye.' Disappointment #2.
I sat back down and started to cry in the lobby of an apartment building in Corona. I
wanted to press all of the buttons and scream curse words at everybody who lived in the
stupid building. I wanted to give myself bruises. I stood up and pressed 9E again. This
rime the voice came out immediately. 'What. Do. You. Want?' I said, 'Thomas Schell was
my dad.'
'And?'
'Was. Not is
. He's dead.' He didn't say anything, but I knew he was pressing the Talk button because I
could hear a beeping in his apartment, and also windows rattling from the same breeze
that I was feeling at ground level. He asked, 'How old are you?' I said seven, because I
wanted him to feel more sorry for me, so he would help me. Lie #34. 'My dad's dead,' I
told him. 'Dead?'
'He's inanimate.' He didn't say anything. I heard more beeping. We just stood there, facing
each other, but nine floors apart. Finally he said, 'He must have died young.'
'Yeah.'
'How old was he?'
'Forty.'
'That's too young.'
'That's true.'
'Can I ask how he died?' I didn't want to talk about it, but I remembered the promises I
43
made to myself about my search, so I told him everything. I heard more beeping and
wondered if his finger was getting tired. He said, 'If you come up, I'll have a look at that
key.'
'I can't go up.'
'Why not?'
'Because you're on the ninth floor and I don't go that high.'
'Why not?'
'It isn't safe.'
'But it's perfectly safe here.'
'Until something happens.'
'You'll be fine.'
'It's a rule.'
'I'd come down for you,' he said, 'but I just can't.'
'Why not?'
'I'm very sick.'
'But my dad is dead.'
'I'm hooked up to all sorts of machines. That's why it took me so long to get to the intercom.'
If I could do it again, I would do it differently. But you can't do it again. I heard the
voice saying, 'Hello? Hello? Please.' I slid my card under the apartment building door and
got away from there as fast as I could.
Abby Black lived in #I in a townhouse on Bedford Street. It took me two hours and
twenty-three minutes to walk there, and my hand got exhausted from shaking my tambourine.
There was a little sign above the door that said the poet Edna Saint Vincent Millay
once lived in the house, and that it was the narrowest house in New York. I wondered
if Edna Saint Vincent Millay was a man or a woman. I tried the key, and it went in halfway,
but then it stopped. I knocked. No one answered, even though I could hear someone
talking inside, and I guessed that #I meant the first floor, so I knocked again. I was willing
to be annoying if that's what was necessary.
A woman opened the door and said, 'Can I help you?' She was incredibly beautiful, with a
face like Mom's, which seemed like it was smiling even when she wasn't smiling, and
huge boobs. I especially liked how her earrings sometimes touched her neck. It made me
wish all of a sudden that I'd brought some kind of invention for her, so that she'd have a
reason to like me. Even something small and simple, like a phosphorus brooch.
'Hi.'
'Hello.'
'Are you Abby Black?'
'Yes.'
'I'm Oskar Schell.'
'Hello.'
44
'Hi.' I told her, 'I'm sure people tell you this constantly, but if you looked up 'incredibly
beautiful' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of you.' She cracked up a bit and said,
'People never tell me that.'
'I bet they do.' She cracked up a bit more. 'They don't.'
'Then you hang out with the wrong people.'
'You might be right about that.'
'Because you're incredibly beautiful.'
She opened the door a bit more. I asked, 'Did you know Thomas Schell?'
'Excuse me?'
'Did you know Thomas Schell?' She thought. I wondered why she had to think. 'No.'
'Are you sure?'
'Yes.' There was something unsure about the way she said she was sure, which made me
think that maybe she was keeping some sort of secret from me. So what would that secret
be? I handed her the envelope and said, 'Does this mean anything to you?' She looked at it
for a while. 'I don't think so. Should it?'
'Only if it does,' I told her. 'It doesn't,' she told me. I didn't believe her.
'Would it be OK if I came in?' I asked. 'Now is not really the best time.'
'Why not?'
'I'm in the middle of something.'
'What kind of something?'
'Is that any of your business?'
'Is that a rhetorical question?'
'Yes.'
'Do you have a job?'
'Yes.'
'What's your job?'
'I am an epidemiologist.'
'You study diseases.'
'Yes.'
'Fascinating.'
'Listen, I don't know what it is that you need, but if it has to do with that envelope, I'm
sure I can't help – '
'I'm extremely thirsty,' I said, touching my throat, which is the universal sign for thirsty.
'There's a deli on the corner.'
'Actually, I'm diabetic and I need some sugar asap.' Lie #35. 'Do you mean A.S.A.P.?'
'Anyway.'
I didn't feel great about lying, and I didn't believe in being able to know what's going to
45
happen before it happens, but for some reason I knew I had to get inside her apartment. In
exchange for the lie, I made a promise to myself that when I got a raise in my allowance, I
would donate part of that raise to people who in reality do have diabetes. She took a heavy
breath, like she was incredibly frustrated, but on the other hand, she didn't ask me to
leave. A man's voice called something from inside. 'Orange juice?' she asked. 'Do you have
any coffee?'
'Follow me,' she said, and she walked into the apartment. 'What about non-dairy creamer?'
I got a look around as I followed her, and everything was clean and perfect. There were
neat photographs on the walls, including one where you could see an African-American
woman's VJ, which made me feel self-conscious. 'Where are the sofa cushions?'
'It doesn't have cushions.'
'What is that?'
'You mean the painting?'
'Your apartment smells good.' The man in the other room called again, this time extremely
loudly, like he was desperate, but she didn't pay any attention, like she didn't hear it, or
didn't care.
I touched a lot of things in her kitchen, because it made me feel OK for some reason. I ran
my finger along the top of her microwave, and it turned gray & visquous; C'est sale,' I said,
showing it to her and cracking up. She became extremely serious. 'That's embarrassing,'
she said. 'You should see my laboratory,' I said. 'I wonder how that could have happened,'
she said. I said, 'Things get dirty.'
'But I like to keep things clean. A woman comes by every week to clean. I've told her a million
times to clean everywhere. I've even pointed that out to her.' I asked her why she was
getting so upset about such a small thing. She said, 'It doesn't feel small to me,' and I
thought about moving a single grain of sand one millimeter. I took a wet wipe from my
field kit and cleaned the microwave.
'Since you're an epidemiologist,' I said, 'did you know that seventy percent of household
dust is actually composed of human epidermal matter?'
'No,' she said, 'I didn't.'
'I'm an amateur epidemiologist.'
'There aren't many of those.'
'Yeah. And I conducted a pretty fascinating experiment once where I told Feliz to save all
the dust from our apartment for a year in a garbage bag for me. Then I weighed it. It
weighed 112 pounds. Then I figured out that seventy percent of 112 pounds is 78.4
pounds. I weigh 76 pounds, 78 pounds when I'm sopping wet. That doesn't actually prove
anything, but it's weird. Where can I put this?'
'Here,' she said, taking the wet wipe from me. I asked her, 'Why are you sad?'
'Excuse me?'
'You're sad. Why?'
The coffee machine gurgled. She opened a cabinet and took out a mug. 'Do you take
46
sugar?' I told her yes, because Dad always took sugar. As soon as she sat down, she got
back up and took a bowl of grapes from her refrigerator. She also took out cookies and put
them on a plate. 'Do you like strawberries?' she asked. 'Yes,' I told her, 'but I'm not hungry.'
She put out some strawberries. I thought it was weird that there weren't any menus
or little magnetic calendars or pictures of kids on her refrigerator. The only thing in the
whole kitchen was a photograph of an elephant on the wall next to the phone. 'I love that,'
I told her, and not just because I wanted her to like me. 'You love what?' she asked. I
pointed at the picture. 'Thank you,' she said. 'I like it, too.'
'I said I loved it.'
'Yes. I love it.'
'How much do you know about elephants?'
'Not too much.'
'Not too much a little? Or not too much nothing?'
'Hardly anything.'
'For example, did you know that scientists used to think that elephants had esp?'
'Do you mean E.S.P.?'
'Anyway, elephants can set up meetings from very faraway locations, and they know
where their friends and enemies are going to be, and they can find water without any geological
clues. No one could figure out how they do all of those things. So what's actually
going on?'
'I don't know.'
'How do they do it?'
'It?'
'How do they set up meetings if they don't have E.S.P.?'
'You're asking me?'
'Yes.'
'I don't know.'
'Do you want to know?'
'Sure.'
'A lot?'
'Sure.'
'They're making very, very, very, very deep calls, way deeper than what humans can hear.
They're talking to each other. Isn't that so awesome?'
'It is.' I ate a strawberry.
'There's this woman who's spent the last couple of years in the Congo or wherever. She's
been making recordings of the calls and putting together an enormous library of them.
This past year she started playing them back.'
'Playing them back?'
47
'To the elephants.'
'Why?' I loved that she asked why. 'As you probably know, elephants have much, much
stronger memories than other mammals.'
'Yes. I think I knew that.'
'So this woman wanted to see just how good their memories actually are. She'd play the
call of an enemy that was recorded a bunch of years earlier – a call they'd heard only once
– and they'd get panicky, and sometimes they'd run. They remembered hundreds of calls.
Thousands. There might not even be a limit. Isn't that fascinating?'
'It is.'
'Because what's really fascinating is that she'd play the call of a dead elephant to its family
members.'
'And?'
'They remembered.'
'What did they do?'
'They approached the speaker.'
'I wonder what they were feeling.'
'What do you mean?'
'When they heard the calls of their dead, was it with love that they approached the jeep?
Or fear? Or anger?'
'I don't remember.'
'Did they charge?'
'I don't remember.'
'Did they cry?'
'Only humans can cry tears. Did you know that?'
'It looks like the elephant in that photograph is crying.' I got extremely close to the picture,
and it was true. 'It was probably manipulated in Photoshop,' I said. 'But just in case, can I
take a picture of your picture?' She nodded and said, 'Didn't I read somewhere that elephants
are the only other animals that bury their dead?'
'No,' I told her as I focused Grandpa's camera, 'you didn't. They just gather the bones.
Only humans bury their dead.'
'Elephants couldn't believe in ghosts.' That made me crack up a little. 'Well, most scientists
wouldn't say so.'
'What would you say?'
'I'm just an amateur scientist.'
'And what would you say?' I took the picture. 'I'd say they were confused.'
Then she started to cry tears.
I thought, I'm the one who's supposed to be crying.
'Don't cry,' I told her. 'Why not?' she asked. 'Because,' I told her. 'Because what?' she asked.
48
Since I didn't know why she was crying, I couldn't think of a reason. Was she crying about
the elephants? Or something else I'd said? Or the desperate person in the other room? Or
something that I didn't know about? I told her, 'I bruise easily.' She said, 'I'm sorry.' I told
her, 'I wrote a letter to that scientist who's making those elephant recordings. I asked if I
could be her assistant. I told her I could make sure there were always blank tapes ready
for recording, and I could boil all the water so it was safe to drink, or even just carry her
equipment. Her assistant wrote back to tell me she already had an assistant, obviously, but
maybe there would be a project in the future that we could work on together.'
'That's great. Something to look forward to.'
'Yeah.'
Someone came to the door of the kitchen who I guessed was the man that had been calling
from the other room. He just stuck his head in extremely quickly, said something I didn't
understand, and walked away. Abby pretended to ignore it, but I didn't. 'Who was that?'
'My husband.'
'Does he need something?'
'I don't care.'
'But he's your husband, and I think he needs something.' She cried more tears. I went over
to her and I put my hand on her shoulder, like Dad used to do with me. I asked her what
she was feeling, because that's what he would ask. 'You must think this is very unusual,'
she said. 'I think a lot of things are very unusual,' I said. She asked, 'How old are you?' I
told her twelve – lie #59 – because I wanted to be old enough for her to love me. 'What's a
twelve-year-old doing knocking on the doors of strangers?'
'I'm trying to find a lock. How old are you?'
'Forty-eight.'
'Jose. You look much younger than that.' She cracked up through her crying and said,
'Thanks.'
'What's a forty-eight-year-old doing inviting strangers into her kitchen?'
'I don't know.'
'I'm being annoying,' I said. 'You're not being annoying,' she said, but it's extremely hard
to believe someone when they tell you that.
I asked, 'Are you sure you didn't know Thomas Schell?' She said, 'I didn't know Thomas
Schell,' but for some reason I still didn't believe her. 'Maybe you know someone else with
the first name Thomas? Or someone else with the last name Schell?'
'No.' I kept thinking there was something she wasn't telling me. I showed her the little envelope
again. 'But this is your last name, right?' She looked at the writing, and I could see
that she recognized something about it. Or I thought I could see it. But then she said, 'I'm
sorry. I don't think I can help you.'
'And what about the key?'
'What key?' I realized I hadn't even shown it to her yet. All of that talking – about dust,
about elephants – and I hadn't gotten to the whole reason I was there.
49
I pulled the key out from under my shirt and put it in her hand. Because the string was
still around my neck, when she leaned in to look at the key, her face came incredibly close
to my face. We were frozen there for a long time. It was like time was stopped. I thought
about the falling body.
'I'm sorry,' she said. 'Why are you sorry?'
'I'm sorry I don't know anything about the key.' Disappointment #3. 'I'm sorry, too.'
Our faces were so incredibly close.
I told her, 'The fall play this fall is Hamlet, in case you're interested. I'm Yorick. We have a
working fountain. If you want to come to opening night, it's twelve weeks from now. It
should be pretty great.' She said, 'I'll try,' and I could feel the breath of her words against
my face. I asked her, 'Could we kiss for a little bit?'
'Excuse me?' she said, although, on the other hand, she didn't pull her head back. 'It's just
that I like you, and I think I can tell that you like me.' She said, 'I don't think that's a good
idea.' Disappointment #4. I asked why not. She said, 'Because I'm forty-eight and you're
twelve.'
'So?'
'And I'm married.'
'So?'
'And I don't even know you.'
'Don't you feel like you know me?' She didn't say anything. I told her, 'Humans are the
only animal that blushes, laughs, has religion, wages war, and kisses with lips. So in a
way, the more you kiss with lips, the more human you are.'
'And the more you wage war?' Then I was the silent one. She said, 'You're a sweet, sweet
boy.' I said, 'Young man.'
'But I don't think it's a good idea.'
'Does it have to be a good idea?'
'I think it does.'
'Can I at least take a picture of you?' She said, 'That would be nice.' But when I started focusing
Grandpa's camera, she put her hand in front of her face for some reason. I didn't
want to force her to explain herself, so I thought of a different picture I could take, which
would be more truthful, anyway. 'Here's my card,' I told her, when the cap was back on
the lens, 'in case you remember anything about the key or just want to talk.'

FAX MACHINE: I DON'T HAVE A FAX MACHINE YET
I went over to Grandma's apartment when I got home, which is what I did basically every
afternoon, because Mom worked at the firm on Saturdays and sometimes even Sundays,
and she got panicky about me being alone. As I got near Grandma's building, I looked up
and didn't see her sitting at her window waiting for me, like she always did. I asked Parley
if she was there, and he said he thought so, so I went up the seventy-two stairs.
I rang the doorbell. She didn't answer, so I opened the door, because she always leaves it
unlocked, even though I don't think that's safe, because sometimes people who seem good
end up being not as good as you might have hoped. As I walked in, she was coming to the
door. It looked almost like she had been crying, but I knew that was impossible, because
once she told me that she emptied herself of tears when Grandpa left. I told her fresh tears
are produced every time you cry. She said, 'Anyway.' Sometimes I wondered if she cried
when no one was looking.
'Oskar!' she said, and lifted me from the ground with one of her hugs. 'I'm OK,' I said. 'Oskar!'
she said again, picking me up in another hug. 'I'm OK,' I said again, and then I asked
her where she'd been. 'I was in the guest room talking to the renter.'
When I was a baby, Grandma would take care of me during the day. Dad told me that she
would give me baths in the sink, and trim my fingernails and toenails with her teeth because
she was afraid of using clippers. When I was old enough to take baths in the bathtub,
and to know I had a penis and a scrotum and everything, I asked her not to sit in the
room with me. 'Why not?'
'Privacy.'
'Privacy from what? From me?' I didn't want to hurt her feelings, because not hurting her
feelings is another of my raisons d'etre. 'Just privacy,' I said. She put her hands on her
stomach and said, 'From me?' She agreed to wait outside, but only if I held a ball of yarn,
which went under the bathroom door and was connected to the scarf she was knitting.
Every few seconds she would give it a tug, and I had to tug back – undoing what she'd just
done – so that she could know I was OK.
She was taking care of me when I was four, chasing me around the apartment like she was
a monster, and I cut my top lip against the end of our coffee table and had to go to the
hospital. Grandma believes in God, but she doesn't believe in taxis, so I bled on my shirt
on the bus. Dad told me it gave her incredibly heavy boots, even though my lip only
needed a couple of stitches, and that she kept coming across the street to tell him, 'It was
all my fault. You should never let him be around me again.' The next time I saw her after
that, she told me, 'You see, I was pretending to be a monster, and I became a monster.'
Grandma stayed at our apartment the week after Dad died, while Mom was going around
Manhattan putting up posters. We had thousands of thumb wars, and I won every single
one, even the ones I was trying to lose. We watched approved documentaries, and cooked
vegan cupcakes, and went for lots of walks in the park. One day I wandered away from
51
her and hid. I liked the way it felt to have someone look for me, to hear my name again
and again. 'Oskar! Oskar!' Maybe I didn't even like it, but I needed it right then.
I followed her around from a safe distance as she started to get incredibly panicky. 'Oskar!'
She was crying and touching everything, but I wouldn't let her know where I was, because
I was sure that the cracking up at the end would make it all OK. I watched her as she
walked home, where I knew she would sit on the stoop of our building and wait for Mom
to come back. She would have to tell her I had disappeared, and that because she wasn't
watching me closely enough, I was gone forever and there would be no more Schells. I ran
ahead, down Eighty-second Street and up Eighty-third, and when she came up to the
building, I jumped out from behind the door. 'But I didn't order a pizza!' I said, cracking
up so hard I thought my neck would burst open.
She started to say something, and then she stopped. Stan took her arm and said, 'Why
don't you sit down, Grandma.' She told him, 'Don't touch me,' in a voice that I'd never
heard from her. Then she turned around and went across the street to her apartment. That
night, I looked through my binoculars at her window and there was a note that said,
'Don't go away.'
Ever since that day, whenever we go on walks she makes us play a game like Marco Polo,
where she calls my name and I have to call back to let her know that I'm OK.
'Oskar.'
'I'm OK.'
'Oskar.'
'I'm OK.'
I'm never exactly sure when we're playing the game and when she's just saying my name,
so I always let her know that I'm OK.
A few months after Dad died, Mom and I went to the storage facility in New Jersey where
Dad kept the stuff that he didn't use anymore but might use again one day, like when he
retired, I guess. We rented a car, and it took us more than two hours to get there, even
though it wasn't far away, because Mom kept stopping to go to the bathroom and wash
her face. The facility wasn't organized very well, and it was extremely dark, so it took us a
long time to find Dad's little room. We got in a fight about his razor, because she said it
should go in the 'throw it away' pile and I told her it should go in the 'save it' pile. She
said, 'Save it for what?' I said, 'It doesn't matter for what.' She said, 'I don't know why he
saved a three-dollar razor in the first place.' I said, 'It doesn't matter why.' She said, 'We
can't save everything.' I said, 'So it will be OK if I throw away all of your things and forget
about you after you die?' As it was coming out of my mouth, I wished it was going into
my mouth. She said she was sorry, which I thought was weird.
One of the things we found were the old two-way radios from when I was a baby. Mom
and Dad put one in the crib so they could hear me crying, and sometimes, instead of coming
to the crib, Dad would just talk into it, which would help me get to sleep. I asked Mom
why he kept those. She said, 'Probably for when you have kids.'
'What the?'
'That's what Dad was like.' I started to realize that a lot of the stuff he'd saved – boxes and
52
boxes of Legos, the set of How It Works books, even the empty photo albums – was probably
for when I had kids. I don't know why, but for some reason that made me angry.
Anyway, I put new batteries in the two-way radios, and I thought it would be a fun way
for me and Grandma to talk. I gave her the baby one, so she wouldn't have to figure out
any buttons, and it worked great. When I'd wake up I'd tell her good morning. And before
I'd go to bed we'd usually talk. She was always waiting for me on the other end. I don't
know how she knew when I'd be there. Maybe she just waited around all day.
'Grandma? Do you read me?'
'Oskar?'
'I'm OK. Over.'
'How did you sleep, darling? Over.'
'What? I couldn't hear that. Over.'
'I asked how did you sleep. Over.'
'Fine,' I'll say, looking at her across the street, my chin in my palm, 'no bad dreams. Over.'
'One hundred dollars. Over.' We never have all that much to say to each other. She tells me
the same stories about Grandpa again and again, like how his hands were rough from
making so many sculptures, and how he could talk to animals. 'You'll come visit me this
afternoon? Over?'
'Yeah. I think so. Over.'
'Please try. Over.'
'I'll try. Over and out.'
Some nights I took the two-way radio into bed with me and rested it on the side of the pillow
that Buckminster wasn't on so I could hear what was going on in her bedroom. Sometimes
she would wake me up in the middle of the night. It gave me heavy boots that she
had nightmares, because I didn't know what she was dreaming about and there was nothing
I could do to help her. She hollered, which woke me up, obviously, so my sleep depended
on her sleep, and when I told her, 'No bad dreams,' I was talking about her.
Grandma knitted me white sweaters, white mittens, and white hats. She knew how much I
liked dehydrated ice cream, which was one of my very few exceptions to veganism, because
it's what astronauts have for dessert, and she went to the Hayden Planetarium and
bought it for me. She picked up pretty rocks to give to me, even though she shouldn't have
been carrying heavy things, and usually they were just Manhattan schist, anyway. A couple
of days after the worst day, when I was on my way to my first appointment with Dr.
Fein, I saw Grandma carrying a huge rock across Broadway. It was as big as a baby and
must have weighed a ton. But she never gave that one to me, and she never mentioned it.
'Oskar.'
'I'm OK.'
One afternoon, I mentioned to Grandma that I was considering starting a stamp collection,
and the next afternoon she had three albums for me and – 'because I love you so much it
hurts me, and because I want your wonderful collection to have a wonderful beginning' –
53
a sheet of stamps of Great American Inventors.
'You've got Thomas Edison,' she said, pointing at one of the stamps, 'and Ben Franklin,
Henry Ford, Eli Whitney, Alexander Graham Bell, George Washington Carver, Nikola
Tesla, whoever that is, the Wright Brothers, J. Robert Oppenheimer – '
'Who's he?'
'He invented the bomb.'
'Which bomb?'
'The bomb.'
'He wasn't a Great Inventor!' She said, 'Great, not good.'
'Grandma?'
'Yes, darling?'
'It's just that where's the plate block?'
'The what?'
'The thing on the side of the sheet with the numbers.'
'With the numbers?'
'Yeah.'
'I got rid of it.'
'You what?'
'I got rid of it. Was that wrong?' I felt myself starting to spaz, even though I was trying not
to. 'Well, it's not worth anything without the plate block!'
'What?'
'The plate block! These stamps. Aren't. Valuable!' She looked at me for a few seconds. 'Yeah,'
she said, 'I guess I heard of that. So I'll go back to the stamp shop tomorrow and get another
sheet. These we can use for the mail.'
'There's no reason to get another,' I told her, wanting to take back the last few things I said
and try them again, being nicer this time, being a better grandson, or just a silent one.
'There is a reason, Oskar.'
'I'm OK.'
We spent so much time together. I don't think there's anyone that I spent more time with,
at least not since Dad died, unless you count Buckminster. But there were a lot of people
that I knew better. For example, I didn't know anything about what it was like when she
was a kid, or how she met Grandpa, or what their marriage was like, or why he left. If I
had to write her life story, all I could say is that her husband could talk to animals, and
that I should never love anything as much as she loved me. So here's my question: What
were we spending so much time doing if not getting to know each other?
'Did you do anything special today?' she asked that afternoon I started my search for the
lock. When I think about everything that happened, from when we buried the coffin to
when I dug it up, I always think about how I could have told her the truth then. It wasn't
too late to turn around, before I got to the place I couldn't come back from. Even if she
54
wouldn't have understood me, I would have been able to say it. 'Yeah,' I said. 'I put the finishing
touches on those scratch-and-sniff earrings for the craft fair. Also I mounted the
eastern tiger swallowtail that Stan found dead on the stoop. And I worked on a bunch of
letters, because I'd gotten behind on those.'
'Who are you writing letters to?' she asked, and it still wasn't too late. 'Kofi Annan, Siegfried,
Roy, Jacques Chirac, E. O. Wilson, Weird Al Yankovic, Bill Gates, Vladimir Putin,
and some other people.' She asked, 'Why don't you write a letter to someone you know?' I
started to tell her, 'I don't know anyone,' but then I heard something. Or I thought I heard
something. There was noise in the apartment, like someone walking around. 'What is
that?' I asked. 'My ears aren't a hundred dollars,' she said. 'But there's someone in the
apartment. Maybe it's the renter?'
'No,' she said, 'he went off to a museum earlier.'
'What museum?'
'I don't know what museum. He said he wouldn't be back until late tonight.'
'But I can hear someone.'
'No you can't,' she said. I said, 'I'm ninety-nine percent sure I can.' She said, 'Maybe it's just
your imagination.' I was in the place that I couldn't come back from.
Thank you for your letter. Because of the large volume of mail I receive, I am unable
to write personal responses. Nevertheless, know that I read and save every letter,
with the hope of one day being able to give each the proper response it deserves.
Until that day,
Most sincerely,
Stephen Hawking
I stayed up pretty late designing jewelry that night. I designed a Nature Hike Anklet,
which leaves a trail of bright yellow dye when you walk, so in case you get lost, you can
find your way back. I also designed a set of wedding rings, where each one takes the pulse
of the person wearing it and sends a signal to the other ring to flash red with each heartbeat.
Also I designed a pretty fascinating bracelet, where you put a rubber band around
your favorite book of poems for a year, and then you take it off and wear it.
I don't know why, but as I was working, I couldn't stop thinking about that day Mom and
I went to the storage facility in New Jersey. I kept going back to it, like a salmon, which I
know about. Mom must have stopped to wash her face ten times. It was so quiet and so
dark, and we were the only people there. What drinks were in the Coke machine? What
fonts were the signs in? I went through the boxes in my brain. I took out a neat old film
projector. What was the last film Dad made? Was I in it? I went through a bunch of the
toothbrushes they give you at the dentist, and three baseballs that Dad had caught at
games, which he wrote the dates on. What were the dates? My brain opened a box with
old atlases (where there were two Germanys and one Yugoslavia) and souvenirs from
business trips, like Russian dolls with dolls inside them with dolls inside them with dolls
inside themÃ¢Â€Â¦Which of those things had Dad kept for when I had kids?
It was 2:36 A.M. I went to Mom's room. She was sleeping, obviously. I watched the sheets
breathe when she breathed, like how Dad used to say that trees inhale when people ex-
55
hale, because I was too young to understand the truth about biological processes. I could
tell that Mom was dreaming, but I didn't want to know what she was dreaming about, because
I had enough of my own nightmares, and if she had been dreaming something
happy, I would have been angry at her for dreaming something happy. I touched her incredibly
gently. She jumped up and said, 'What is it?' I said, 'It's OK.' She grabbed my
shoulders and said, 'What is it?' The way she was holding me hurt my arms, but I didn't
show anything. 'Remember when we went to the storage facility in New Jersey?' She let go
of me and lay back down. 'What?'
'Where Dad's stuff is. Remember?'
'It's the middle of the night, Oskar.'
'What was it called?'
'Oskar.'
'It's just that what was the name of the place?' She reached for her glasses on the bedside
table, and I would have given all of my collections, and all of the jewelry I'd ever made,
and all future birthday and Christmas presents just to hear her say 'Black Storage.' Or
'Blackwell Storage.' Or 'Blackman.' Or even 'Midnight Storage.' Or 'Dark Storage.' Or
'Rainbow.'
She made a weird face, like someone was hurting her, and said, 'Store-a-Lot.'
I'd lost count of the disappointments.
WHY I'M NOT WHERE YOU ARE
 5/21/63
Your mother and I never talk about the past, that's a rule. I go to the door when she's using
the bathroom, and she never looks over my shoulder when I'm writing, those are two
more rules. I open doors for her but I never touch her back as she passes through, she
never lets me watch her cook, she folds my pants but leaves my shirts by the ironing
board, I never light candles when she's in the room, but I do blow candles out. It's a rule
that we never listen to sad music, we made that rule early on, songs are as sad as the listener,
we hardly ever listen to music. I change the sheets every morning to wash away my
writing, we never sleep in the same bed twice, we never watch television shows about sick
children, she never asks me how my day was, we always eat on the same side of the table,
facing the window. So many rules, sometimes I can't remember what's a rule and what isn't,
if anything we do is for its own sake, I'm leaving her today, is that the rule we've been
organizing ourselves around this whole time, or am I about to break the organizing rule? I
used to ride the bus here at the end of every week, to take the magazines and newspapers
that people left behind when they got on their planes, your mother reads and reads and
reads, she wants English, as much as she can get her hands on, is that a rule? I'd come late
56
Friday afternoon, it used to be that I would go home with a magazine or two and maybe a
paper, but she wanted more, more slang, more figures of speech, the bee's knees, the cat's
pajamas, horse of a different color, dog-tired, she wanted to talk like she was born here,
like she never came from anywhere else, so I started bringing a knapsack, which I would
stuff with as much as would fit, it got heavy, my shoulders burned with English, she
wanted more English, so I brought a suitcase, I filled it until I could barely zip the zipper,
the suitcase sagged with English, my arms burned with English, my hands did, my knuckles,
people must have thought I was actually going somewhere, the next morning my back
ached with English, I found myself sticking around, spending more time than was necessary,
watching the planes bring people and take people away, I started coming twice a
week and staying for several hours, when it was time to go home I didn't want to leave,
and when I wasn't here, I wanted to be here, now I come every morning before we open
the store, and every evening after dinner, so what is it, am I hoping to see someone I know
get off one of the planes, am I waiting for a relative who never will come, do I expect
Anna? No, that's not it, it's not about my joy, the relief of my burden. I like to see people
reunited, maybe that's a silly thing, but what can I say, I like to see people run to each
other, I like the kissing and the crying, I like the impatience, the stories that the mouth
can't tell fast enough, the ears that aren't big enough, the eyes that can't take in all of the
change, I like the hugging, the bringing together, the end of missing someone, I sit on the
side with a coffee and write in my daybook, I examine the flight schedules that I've already
memorized, I observe, I write, I try not to remember the life that I didn't want to lose
but lost and have to remember, being here fills my heart with so much joy, even if the joy
isn't mine, and at the end of the day I fill the suitcase with old news. Maybe that was the
story I was telling myself when I met your mother, I thought we could run to each other, I
thought we could have a beautiful reunion, although we had hardly known each other in
Dresden. It didn't work. We've wandered in place, our arms outstretched, but not toward
each other, they're marking off distance, everything between us has been a rule to govern
our life together, everything a measurement, a marriage of millimeters, of rules, when she
gets up to go to the shower, I feed the animals – that's a rule – so she doesn't have to be
self-conscious, she finds things to keep herself busy when I undress at night – rule – she
goes to the door to make sure it's locked, she double-checks the oven, she tends to her collections
in the china cabinet, she checks, again, the curlers that she hasn't used since we
met, and when she gets undressed, I've never been so busy in my life. Only a few months
into our marriage, we started marking off areas in the apartment as 'Nothing Places,' in
which one could be assured of complete privacy, we agreed that we never would look at
the marked-off zones, that they would be nonexistent territories in the apartment in which
one could temporarily cease to exist, the first was in the bedroom, by the foot of the bed,
we marked it off with red tape on the carpet, and it was just large enough to stand in, it
was a good place to disappear, we knew it was there but we never looked at it, it worked
so well that we decided to create a Nothing Place in the living room, it seemed necessary,
because there are times when one needs to disappear while in the living room, and sometimes
one simply wants to disappear, we made this zone slightly larger so that one of us
could lie down in it, it was a rule that you never would look at that rectangle of space, it
didn't exist, and when you were in it, neither did you, for a while that was enough, but
57
only for a while, we required more rules, on our second anniversary we marked off the
entire guest room as a Nothing Place, it seemed like a good idea at the time, sometimes a
small patch at the foot of the bed or a rectangle in the living room isn't enough privacy, the
side of the door that faced the guest room was Nothing, the side that faced the hallway
was Something, the knob that connected them was neither Something nor Nothing. The
walls of the hallway were Nothing, even pictures need to disappear, especially pictures,
but the hallway itself was Something, the bathtub was Nothing, the bathwater was Something,
the hair on our bodies was Nothing, of course, but once it collected around the drain
it was Something, we were trying to make our lives easier, trying, with all of our rules, to
make life effortless. But a friction began to arise between Nothing and Something, in the
morning the Nothing vase cast a Something shadow, like the memory of someone you've
lost, what can you say about that, at night the Nothing light from the guest room spilled
under the Nothing door and stained the Something hallway, there's nothing to say. It became
difficult to navigate from Something to Something without accidentally walking
through Nothing, and when Something – a key, a pen, a pocketwatch – was accidentally
left in a Nothing Place, it never could be retrieved, that was an unspoken rule, like nearly
all of our rules have been. There came a point, a year or two ago, when our apartment was
more Nothing than Something, that in itself didn't have to be a problem, it could have
been a good thing, it could have saved us. We got worse. I was sitting on the sofa in the
second bedroom one afternoon, thinking and thinking and thinking, when I realized I was
on a Something island. 'How did I get here,' I wondered, surrounded by Nothing, 'and
how can I get back?' The longer your mother and I lived together, the more we took each
other's assumptions for granted, the less was said, the more misunderstood, I'd often remember
having designated a space as Nothing when she was sure we had agreed that it
was Something, our unspoken agreements led to disagreements, to suffering, I started to
undress right in front of her, this was just a few months ago, and she said, 'Thomas! What
are you doing!' and I gestured, 'I thought this was Nothing,' covering myself with one of
my daybooks, and she said, 'It's Something!' We took the blueprint of our apartment from
the hallway closet and taped it to the inside of the front door, with an orange and a green
marker we separated Something from Nothing. 'This is Something,' we decided.
'This is Nothing.'
'Something.'
'Something.'
'Nothing.'
'Something.'
'Nothing.'
'Nothing.'
'Nothing.' Everything was forever fixed, there would be only peace and happiness, it wasn't
until last night, our last night together, that the inevitable question finally arose, I told
her, 'Something,' by covering her face with my hands and then lifting them like a marriage
veil. 'We must be.' But I knew, in the most protected part of my heart, the truth.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
58
The beautiful girl didn't know the time, she was in a hurry, she said, 'Good luck,' I smiled,
she hurried off, her skirt catching the air as she ran, sometimes I can hear my bones straining
under the weight of all of the lives I'm not living. In this life, I'm sitting in an airport
trying to explain myself to my unborn son, I'm filling the pages of this, my last daybook,
I'm thinking of a loaf of black bread that I left out one night, the next morning I saw the
outline of the mouse that had eaten through it, I cut the loaf into slices and saw the mouse
at each moment, I'm thinking of Anna, I would give everything never to think about her
again, I can only hold on to the things I want to lose, I'm thinking of the day we met, she
accompanied her father to meet my father, they were friends, they had talked about art
and literature before the war, but once the war began, they talked only about war, I saw
her approaching when she was still far away, I was fifteen, she was seventeen, we sat together
on the grass while our fathers spoke inside, how could we have been younger? We
talked about nothing in particular, but it felt like we were talking about the most important
things, we pulled fistfuls of grass, and I asked her if she liked to read, she said, 'No,
but there are books that I love, love, love,' she said it just like that, three times, 'Do you like
to dance?' she asked, 'Do you like to swim?' I asked, we looked at each other until it felt
like everything would burst into flames, 'Do you like animals?'
'Do you like bad weather?'
'Do you like your friends?' I told her about my sculpture, she said, 'I'm sure you will be a
great artist.'
'How can you be sure?'
'I just am.' I told her I already was a great artist, because that's how unsure of myself I was,
she said, 'I meant famous,' I told her that wasn't what mattered to me, she asked what mattered
to me, I told her I did it for its own sake, she laughed and said, 'You don't understand
yourself,' I said, 'Of course I do,' she said, 'Of course,' I said, 'I do!' She said, 'There's
nothing wrong with not understanding yourself,' she saw through the shell of me into the
center of me, 'Do you like music?' Our fathers came out of the house and stood at the door,
one of them asked, 'What are we going to do?' I knew that our time together was almost
over, I asked her if she liked sports, she asked me if I liked chess, I asked her if she liked
fallen trees, she went home with her father, the center of me followed her, but I was left
with the shell of me, I needed to see her again, I couldn't explain my need to myself, and
that's why it was such a beautiful need, there's nothing wrong with not understanding
yourself. The next day, I walked half an hour to her house, fearing someone would see me
on the road between our neighborhoods, too much to explain that I couldn't explain, I
wore a broad-brimmed hat and kept my head down, I heard the footsteps of those passing
me, and I didn't know if they were a man's, woman's, or child's, I felt as if I were walking
the rungs of a ladder laid flat, I was too ashamed or embarrassed to make myself known to
her, how would I have explained it, was I walking up the ladder or down? I hid behind a
mound of earth that had been dug up to make a grave for some old books, literature was
the only religion her father practiced, when a book fell on the floor he kissed it, when he
was done with a book he tried to give it away to someone who would love it, and if he
couldn't find a worthy recipient, he buried it, I looked for her all day but didn't see her, not
in the yard, not through a window, I promised myself I would stay until I found her, but
59
as night began to come in, I knew I had to go home, I hated myself for going, why couldn't
I be the kind of person who stays? I walked back with my head down, I couldn't stop
thinking about her even though I hardly knew her, I didn't know what good would come
of going to see her, but I knew that I needed to be near her, it occurred to me, as I walked
back to her the next day with my head down, that she might not be thinking of me. The
books had been buried, so I hid this time behind a group of trees, I imagined their roots
wrapped around books, pulling nourishment from the pages, I imagined rings of letters in
their trunks, I waited for hours, I saw your mother in one of the second-floor windows,
she was just a girl, she looked back at me, but I didn't see Anna. A leaf fell, it was yellow
like paper, I had to go home, and then, the next day, I had to go back to her. I skipped my
classes, the walk happened so quickly, my neck strained from hiding my face, my arm
brushed the arm of someone passing – a strong, solid arm – and I tried to imagine whom it
belonged to, a farmer, a stoneworker, a carpenter, a bricklayer. When I got to her house I
hid beneath one of the back windows, a train rattled past in the distance, people coming,
people leaving, soldiers, children, the window shook like an eardrum, I waited all day, did
she go on some sort of trip, was she on an errand, was she hiding from me? When I came
home my father told me that her father had paid another visit, I asked him why he was out
of breath, he said, 'Things keep getting worse,' I realized that her father and I must have
passed each other on the road that morning. 'What things?' Was his the strong arm I felt
brushing past me? 'Everything. The world.' Did he see me, or did my hat and lowered
head protect me? 'Since when?' Perhaps his head was down, too. 'Since the beginning.' The
harder I tried not to think about her, the more I thought about her, the more impossible it
became to explain, I went back to her house, I walked the road between our two neighborhoods
with my head down, she wasn't there again, I wanted to call her name, but I didn't
want her to hear my voice, all of my desire was based on that one brief exchange, held in
the palm of our half hour together were one hundred million arguments, and impossible
admissions, and silences. I had so much to ask her, 'Do you like to lie on your stomach and
look for things under the ice?'
'Do you like plays?'
'Do you like it when you can hear something before you can see it?' I went again the next
day, the walk was exhausting, with each step I further convinced myself that she had
thought badly of me, or worse, that she hadn't thought of me at all, I walked with my head
bowed, my broad-brimmed cap pushed low, when you hide your face from the world,
you can't see the world, and that's why, in the middle of my youth, in the middle of
Europe, in between our two villages, on the verge of losing everything, I bumped into
something and was knocked to the ground. It took me several breaths to gather myself together,
at first I thought I'd walked into a tree, but then that tree became a person, who
was also recovering on the ground, and then I saw that it was her, and she saw that it was
me, 'Hello,' I said, brushing myself off, 'Hello,' she said. 'This is so funny.'
'Yes.' How could it be explained? 'Where are you going?' I asked. 'Just for a walk,' she said,
'and you?'
'Just for a walk.' We helped each other up, she brushed leaves from my hair, I wanted to
touch her hair, 'That's not true,' I said, not knowing what the next words out of my mouth
60
would be, but wanting them to be mine, wanting, more than I'd ever wanted anything, to
express the center of me and be understood. 'I was walking to see you.' I told her, 'I've
come to your house each of the last six days. For some reason I needed to see you again.'
She was silent, I had made a fool of myself, there's nothing wrong with not understanding
yourself and she started laughing, laughing harder than I'd ever felt anyone laugh, the
laughter brought on tears, and the tears brought on more tears, and then I started laughing,
out of the most deep and complete shame, 'I was walking to you,' I said again, as if to
push my nose into my own shit, 'because I wanted to see you again,' she laughed and
laughed, 'That explains it,' she said when she was able to speak. 'It?'
'That explains why, each of the last six days, you weren't at your house.' We stopped
laughing, I took the world into me, rearranged it, and sent it back out as a question: 'Do
you like me?'
Do you know what time it is?
He told me it's 9:38, he looked so much like me, I could tell that he saw it, too, we shared
the smile of recognizing ourselves in each other, how many imposters do I have? Do we all
make the same mistakes, or has one of us gotten it right, or even just a bit less wrong, am I
the imposter? I just told myself the time, and I'm thinking of your mother, how young and
old she is, how she carries around her money in an envelope, how she makes me wear
suntan lotion no matter what the weather, how she sneezes and says, 'God bless me,' God
bless her. She's at home now, writing her life story, she's typing while I'm leaving, unaware
of the chapters to come. It was my suggestion, and at the time I thought it was a
very good one, I thought maybe if she could express herself rather than suffer herself, if
she had a way to relieve the burden, she lived for nothing more than living, with nothing
to get inspired by, to care for, to call her own, she helped out at the store, then came home
and sat in her big chair and stared at her magazines, not at them but through them, she let
the dust accumulate on her shoulders. I pulled my old typewriter from the closet and set
her up in the guest room with everything she'd need, a card table for a desk, a chair, paper,
some glasses, a pitcher of water, a hotplate, some flowers, crackers, it wasn't a proper
office but it would do, she said, 'But it's a Nothing Place,' I wrote, 'What better place to
write your life story?' She said, 'My eyes are crummy,' I told her they were good enough,
she said, 'They barely work,' putting her fingers over them, but I knew she was just embarrassed
by the attention, she said, 'I don't know how to write,' I told her there's nothing
to know, just let it come out, she put her hands on the typewriter, like a blind person feeling
someone's face for the first time, and said, 'I've never used one of these before,' I told
her, 'Just press the keys,' she said she would try, and though I'd known how to use a
typewriter since I was a boy, trying was more than I ever could do. For months it was the
same, she would wake up at 4 A.M. and go to the guest room, the animals would follow
her, I would come here, I wouldn't see her again until breakfast, and then after work we'd
go our separate ways and not see each other until it was time to fall asleep, was I worried
about her, putting all of her life into her life story, no, I was so happy for her, I remembered
the feeling she was feeling, the exhilaration of building the world anew, I heard
from behind the door the sounds of creation, the letters pressing into the paper, the pages
being pulled from the machine, everything being, for once, better than it was and as good
as it could be, everything full of meaning, and then one morning this spring, after years of
61
working in solitude. She said, 'I'd like to show you something.' I followed her to the guest
room, she pointed in the direction of the card table in the corner, on which the typewriter
was wedged between two stacks of paper of about the same height, we walked over together,
she touched everything on the table and then handed me the stack on the left, she
said, 'My Life.'
'Excuse me?' I asked by shrugging my shoulders, she tapped the page, 'My Life,' she said
again, I riffled the pages, there must have been a thousand of them, I put the stack down,
'What is this?' I asked by putting her palms on the tops of my hands and then turning my
palms upward, flipping her hands off mine, 'My Life,' she said, so proudly, 'I just made it
up to the present moment. Just now. I'm all caught up with myself. The last thing I wrote
was 'I'm going to show him what I've written. I hope he loves it.' I picked up the pages and
wandered through them, trying to find the one on which she was born, her first love,
when she last saw her parents, and I was looking for Anna, too, I searched and searched, I
got a paper cut on my forefinger and bled a little flower onto the page on which I should
have seen her kissing somebody, but this was all I saw:
[3 empty pages]
I wanted to cry but I didn't cry, I probably should have cried, I should have drowned us
there in the room, ended our suffering, they would have found us floating face-down in
two thousand white pages, or buried under the salt of my evaporated tears, I remembered,
just then and far too late, that years before I had pulled the ribbon from the machine, it
had been an act of revenge against the typewriter and against myself, I'd pulled it into one
long thread, unwinding the negative it held – the future homes I had created for Anna, the
letters I wrote without response – as if it would protect me from my actual life. But worse
– it's unspeakable, write it! – I realized that your mother couldn't see the emptiness, she
couldn't see anything. I knew that she'd had difficulty, I'd felt her grasp my arm when we
walked, I'd heard her say, 'My eyes are crummy,' but I thought it was a way to touch me,
another figure of speech, why didn't she ask for help, why, instead, did she ask for all of
those magazines and papers if she couldn't see them, was that how she asked for help?
Was that why she held so tightly to railings, why she wouldn't cook with me watching, or
change her clothes with me watching, or open doors? Did she always have something to
read in front of her so she wouldn't have to look at anything else? All of the words I'd
written to her over all of those years, had I never said anything to her at all? 'Wonderful,' I
told her by rubbing her shoulder in a certain way that we have between us, 'it's wonderful.'

'Go ahead,' she said, 'Tell me what you think.' I put her hand on the side of my face, I tilted
my head toward my shoulder, in the context in which she thought our conversation was
taking place that meant, 'I can't read it here like this. I'll take it to the bedroom, I'll read it
slowly, carefully, I'll give your life story what it deserves.' But in what I knew to be the
context of our conversation it meant, 'I have failed you.'
Do you know what time it is?
The first time Anna and I made love was behind her father's shed, the previous owner had
been a farmer, but Dresden started to overtake the surrounding villages and the farm was
divided into nine plots of land, Anna's family owned the largest. The walls of the shed col-
62
lapsed one autumn afternoon – 'a leaf too many,' her father joked – and the next day he
made new walls of shelves, so that the books themselves would separate inside from outside.
(The new, overhanging roof protected the books from rain, but during the winter the
pages would freeze together, come spring, they let out a sigh.) He made a little salon of the
space, carpets, two small couches, he loved to go out there in the evenings with a glass of
whiskey and a pipe, and take down books and look through the wall at the center of the
city. He was an intellectual, although he wasn't important, maybe he would have been
important if he had lived longer, maybe great books were coiled within him like springs,
books that could have separated inside from outside. The day Anna and I made love for
the first time, he met me in the yard, he was standing with a disheveled man whose curly
hair sprang up in every direction, whose glasses were bent, whose white shirt was stained
with the fingerprints of his print-stained hands, 'Thomas, please meet my friend Simon
Goldberg.' I said hello, I didn't know who he was or why I was being introduced to him, I
wanted to find Anna, Mr. Goldberg asked me what I did, his voice was handsome and
broken, like a cobblestone street, I told him, 'I don't do anything,' he laughed, 'Don't be so
modest,' Anna's father said. 'I want to be a sculptor.' Mr. Goldberg took off his glasses, untucked
his shirt from his pants, and cleaned his lenses with his shirttail. 'You want to be a
sculptor?' I said, 'I am trying to be a sculptor.' He put his glasses back on his face, pulling
the wire earpieces behind his ears, and said, 'In your case, trying is being.'
'What do you do?' I asked, in a voice more challenging than I'd wanted. He said, 'I don't
do anything anymore.' Anna's father told him, 'Don't be so modest,' although he didn't
laugh this time, and he told me, 'Simon is one of the great minds of our age.'
'I'm trying,' Mr. Goldberg said to me, as if only the two of us existed. 'Trying what?' I
asked, in a voice more concerned than I'd wanted, he took off his glasses again, 'Trying to
be.' While her father and Mr. Goldberg spoke inside the makeshift salon, whose books
separated inside from outside, Anna and I went for a walk over the reeds that lay across
the gray-green clay by what once was a stall for horses, and down to where you could see
the edge of the water if you knew where and how to look, we got mud halfway up our
socks, and juice from the fallen fruit we kicked out of our way, from the top of the property
we could see the busy train station, the commotion of the war grew nearer and nearer,
soldiers went east through our town, and refugees went west, or stayed there, trains arrived
and departed, hundreds of them, we ended where we began, outside the shed that
was a salon. 'Let's sit down,' she said, we lowered ourselves to the ground, our backs
against the shelves, we could hear them talking inside and smell the pipe smoke that
seeped between the books, Anna started kissing me, 'But what if they come out?' I whispered,
she touched my ears, which meant their voices would keep us safe. She put her
hands all over me, I didn't know what she was doing, I touched every part of her, what
was I doing, did we understand something that we couldn't explain? Her father said, 'You
can stay for as long as you need. You can stay forever.' She pulled her shirt over her head,
I held her breasts in my hands, it was awkward and it was natural, she pulled my shirt
over my head, in the moment I couldn't see, Mr. Goldberg laughed and said, 'Forever,' I
heard him pacing in the small room, I put my hand under her skirt, between her legs, everything
felt on the verge of bursting into flames, without any experience I knew what to
do, it was exactly as it had been in my dreams, as if all the information had been coiled
63
within me like a spring, everything that was happening had happened before and would
happen again, 'I don't recognize the world anymore,' Anna's father said, Anna rolled onto
her back, behind a wall of books through which voices and pipe smoke escaped, 'I want to
make love,' Anna whispered, I knew exactly what to do, night was arriving, trains were
departing, I lifted her skirt, Mr. Goldberg said, 'I've never recognized it more,' and I could
hear him breathing on the other side of the books, if he had taken one from the shelf he
would have seen everything. But the books protected us. I was in her for only a second before
I burst into flames, she whimpered, Mr. Goldberg stomped his foot and let out a cry
like a wounded animal, I asked her if she was upset, she shook her head no, I fell onto her,
resting my cheek against her chest, and I saw your mother's face in the second-floor window,
'Then why are you crying?' I asked, exhausted and experienced, 'War!' Mr. Goldberg
said, angry and defeated, his voice trembling: 'We go on killing each other to no purpose!
It is war waged by humanity against humanity, and it will only end when there's no one
left to fight!' She said, 'It hurt.'
Do you know what time it is?
Every morning before breakfast, and before I come here, your mother and I go to the guest
room, the animals follow us, I thumb through the blank pages and gesture laughter and
gesture tears, if she asks what I'm laughing or crying about, I tap my finger on the page,
and if she asks, 'Why?' I press her hand against her heart, and then against my heart, or I
touch her forefinger to the mirror, or touch it, quickly, against the hotplate, sometimes I
wonder if she knows, I wonder in my Nothingest moments if she's testing me, if she types
nonsense all day long, or types nothing at all, just to see what I'll do in response, she wants
to know if I love her, that's all anyone wants from anyone else, not love itself but the
knowledge that love is there, like new batteries in the flashlight in the emergency kit in the
hall closet, 'Don't let anyone see it,' I told her that morning she first showed it to me, and
maybe I was trying to protect her, and maybe I was trying to protect myself, 'We'll have it
be our secret until it's perfect. We'll work on it together. We'll make it the greatest book
anyone has ever written.'
'You think that's possible?' she asked, outside, leaves fell from the trees, inside, we were
letting go of our concern for that kind of truth, 'I do,' I said by touching her arm, 'If we try
hard enough.' She reached her hands in front of her and found my face, she said, 'I'm going
to write about this.' Ever since that day I've been encouraging her, begging her, to
write more, to shovel deeper, 'Describe his face,' I tell her, running my hand over the
empty page, and then, the next morning, 'Describe his eyes,' and then, holding the page to
the window, letting it fill with light, 'Describe his irises,' and then, 'His pupils.' She never
asks, 'Whose?' She never asks, 'Why?' Are they my own eyes on those pages? I've seen the
left stack double and quadruple, I've heard of asides that have become tangents that have
become passages that have become chapters, and I know, because she told me, that what
was once the second sentence is now the second-to-last. Just two days ago she said that her
life story was happening faster than her life, 'What do you mean?' I asked with my hands,
'So little happens,' she said, 'and I'm so good at remembering.'
'You could write about the store?'
'I've described every diamond in the case.'
64
'You could write about other people.'
'My life story is the story of everyone I've ever met.'
'You could write about your feelings.' She asked, 'Aren't my life and my feelings the same
thing?'
Excuse me, where do you get tickets?
I have so much to tell you, the problem isn't that I'm running out of time, I'm running out
of room, this book is filling up, there couldn't be enough pages, I looked around the
apartment this morning for one last time and there was writing everywhere, filling the
walls and mirrors, I'd rolled up the rugs so I could write on the floors, I'd written on the
windows and around the bottles of wine we were given but never drank, I wear only short
sleeves, even when it's cold, because my arms are books, too. But there's too much to express.
I'm sorry. That's what I've been trying to say to you, I'm sorry for everything. For
having said goodbye to Anna when maybe I could have saved her and our idea, or at least
died with them. I'm sorry for my inability to let the unimportant things go, for my inability
to hold on to the important things. I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to your mother
and to you. I'm sorry I'll never get to see your face, and feed you, and tell you bedtime stories.
I've tried in my own way to explain myself, but when I think of your mother's life
story, I know that I haven't explained a thing, she and I are no different, I've been writing
Nothing, too. 'The dedication,' she said to me this morning, just a few hours ago, when I
went to the guest room for the last time, 'Read it.' I touched my fingers to her eyelids and
opened her eyes wide enough to convey every possible meaning, I was about to leave her
behind without saying goodbye, to turn my back on a marriage of millimeters and rules,
'Do you think it's too much?' she asked, bringing me back to her invisible dedication, I
touched her with my right hand, not knowing to whom she had dedicated her life story,
'It's not silly, is it?' I touched her with my right hand, and I was missing her already, I
wasn't having second thoughts, but I was having thoughts, 'It's not vain?' I touched her
with my right hand, and for all I knew she'd dedicated it to herself, 'Does it mean everything
to you?' she asked, this time putting her finger on what wasn't there, I touched her
with my left hand, and for all I knew she'd dedicated it to me. I told her that I had to get
going. I asked her, with a long series of gestures that would have made no sense to anyone
else, if she wanted anything special. 'You always get it right,' she said. 'Some nature magazines?'
(I flapped her hands like wings.) 'That would be nice.'
'Maybe something with art in it?' (I took her hand, like a brush, and painted an imaginary
painting in front of us.) 'Sure.' She walked me to the door, as she always did, 'I might not
be back before you fall asleep,' I told her, putting my open hand on her shoulder and then
easing her cheek onto my palm. She said, 'But I can't fall asleep without you.' I held her
hands against my head and nodded that she could, we walked to the door, navigating a
Something path. 'And what if I can't fall asleep without you?' I held her hands against my
head and nodded, 'And what if?' I nodded, 'Answer me what,' she said, I shrugged my
shoulders, 'Promise me you'll take care,' she said, pulling the hood of my coat over my
head, 'Promise me you'll take extra-special care. I know you look both ways before you
cross the street, but I want you to look both ways a second time, because I told you to.' I
nodded. She asked, 'Are you wearing lotion?' With my hands I told her, 'It's cold out. You
65
have a cold.' She asked, 'But are you?' I surprised myself by touching her with my right
hand. I could live a lie, but not bring myself to tell that small one. She said, 'Hold on,' and
ran inside the apartment and came back with a bottle of lotion. She squeezed some into
her hand, rubbed her hands together, and spread it on the back of my neck, and on the
tops of my hands, and between my fingers, and on my nose and forehead and cheeks and
chin, everything that was exposed, in the end I was the clay and she was the sculptor, I
thought, it's a shame that we have to live, but it's a tragedy that we get to live only one life,
because if I'd had two lives, I would have spent one of them with her. I would have stayed
in the apartment with her, torn the blueprint from the door, held her on the bed, said, 'I
want two rolls,' sang, 'Start spreading the news,' laughed, 'Ha ha ha!' cried, 'Help!' I would
have spent that life among the living. We rode the elevator down together and walked to
the threshold, she stopped and I kept going. I knew I was about to destroy what she'd
been able to rebuild, but I had only one life. I heard her behind me. Because of myself, or
despite myself, I turned back, 'Don't cry,' I told her, by putting her fingers on my face and
pushing imaginary tears up my cheeks and back into my eyes, 'I know,' she said as she
wiped the real tears from her cheeks, I stomped my feet, this meant, 'I won't go to the airport.'

'Go to the airport,' she said, I touched her chest, then pointed her hand out toward the
world, then pointed her hand at her chest, 'I know,' she said, 'Of course I know that.' I held
her hands and pretended we were behind an invisible wall, or behind the imaginary painting,
our palms exploring its surface, then, at the risk of saying too much, I held one of her
hands over my eyes, and the other over her eyes, 'You are too good to me,' she said, I put
her hands on my head and nodded yes, she laughed, I love it when she laughs, although
the truth is I am not in love with her, she said, 'I love you,' I told her how I felt, this is how
I told her: I held her hands out to her sides, I pointed her index fingers toward each other
and slowly, very slowly, moved them in, the closer they got, the more slowly I moved
them, and then, as they were about to touch, as they were only a dictionary page from
touching, pressing on opposite sides of the word 'love,' I stopped them, I stopped them
and held them there. I don't know what she thought, I don't know what she understood,
or what she wouldn't allow herself to understand, I turned around and walked away from
her, I didn't look back, I won't. I'm telling you all of this because I'll never be your father,
and you will always be my child. I want you to know, at least, that it's not out of selfishness
that I am leaving, how can I explain that? I can't live, I've tried and I can't. If that
sounds simple, it's simple like a mountain is simple. Your mother suffered, too, but she
chose to live, and lived, be her son and her husband. I don't expect that you'll ever understand
me, much less forgive me, you might not even read these words, if your mother
gives them to you at all. It's time to go. I want you to be happy, I want that more than I
want happiness for myself, does that sound simple? I'm leaving. I'll rip these pages from
this book, take them to the mailbox before I get on the plane, address the envelope to 'My
Unborn Child,' and I'll never write another word again, I am gone, I am no longer here.
With love, Your father
I want to buy a ticket to Dresden.
What are you doing here?
66
You have to go home. You should be in bed.
Let me take you home.
You're being crazy. You're going to catch a cold.
You're going to catch a colder.
HEAVY BOOTS
HEAVIER BOOTS
 Twelve weekends later was the first performance of Hamlet, although it was actually an
abbreviated modern version, because the real Hamlet is too long and confusing, and most
of the kids in my class have ADD. For example, the famous 'To be or not to be' speech,
which I know about from the Collected Shakespeare set Grandma bought me, was cut down
so that it was just, 'To be or not to be, that's the question.'
Everyone had to have a part, but there weren't enough real parts, and I didn't go to the
auditions because my boots were too heavy to go to school that day, so I got the part of
Yorick. At first that made me self-conscious. I suggested to Mrs. Rigley that maybe I could
just play tambourine in the orchestra or something. She said, 'There is no orchestra.' I said,
'Still.' She told me, 'It'll be terrific. You'll wear all black, and the makeup crew will paint
your hands and neck black, and the costume crew will create some sort of a papier-mâché
skull for you to wear over your head. It'll really give the illusion that you don't have a
body.' I thought about that for a minute, and then I told her my better idea. 'What I'll do is,
I'll invent an invisibility suit that has a camera on my back that takes video of everything
behind me and plays it on a plasma screen that I'll wear on my front, which will cover everything
except my face. It'll look like I'm not there at all.' She said, 'Nifty.' I said, 'But is Yorick
even a part?' She whispered into my ear, 'If anything, I'm afraid you'll steal the show.'
Then I was excited to be Yorick.
Opening night was pretty great. We had a fog machine, so the cemetery was just like a
cemetery in a movie. 'Alas, poor Yorick!' Jimmy Snyder said, holding my face, 'I knew
him, Horatio.' I didn't have a plasma screen, because the costumes budget wasn't big
enough, but from underneath the skull I could look around without anyone noticing. I saw
lots of people I knew, which made me feel special. Mom and Ron and Grandma were
there, obviously. Toothpaste was there with Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, which was nice, and
Mr. and Mrs. Minch were there, too, because The Minch was Guildenstern. A lot of the
Blacks that I had met in those twelve weekends were there. Abe was there. Ada and Agnes
were there. (They were actually sitting next to each other, although they didn't realize it.) I
saw Albert and Alice and Allen and Arnold and Barbara and Barry. They must have been
half the audience. But what was weird was that they didn't know what they had in common,
which was kind of like how I didn't know what the thumbtack, the bent spoon, the
67
square of aluminum foil, and all those other things I dug up in Central Park had to do
with each other.
I was incredibly nervous, but I maintained my confidence, and I was extremely subtle. I
know, because there was a standing ovation, which made me feel like one hundred dollars.

The second performance was also pretty great. Mom was there, but Ron had to work late.
That was OK, though, because I didn't want him there anyway. Grandma was there, obviously.
I didn't see any of the Blacks, but I knew that most people go to only one show
unless they're your parents, so I didn't feel too bad about that. I tried to give an extraspecial
performance, and I think I did. 'Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio; a really
funny and excellent guy. I used to ride on his back all the time, and now, it's so awful to
think about!'
Only Grandma came the next night. Mom had a late meeting because one of her cases was
about to go to trial, and I didn't ask where Ron was because I was embarrassed, and I didn't
want him there anyway. As I was standing as still as I could, with Jimmy Snyder's hand
under my chin, I wondered, What's the point of giving an extremely subtle performance if basically
no one is watching?
 Grandma didn't come backstage to say hi before the performance the next night, or bye
after, but I saw that she was there. Through the eye sockets I could see her standing in the
back of the gym, underneath the basketball hoop. Her makeup was absorbing the lighting
in a fascinating way, which made her look almost ultraviolet. 'Alas, poor Yorick.' I was as
still as I could be, and the whole time I was thinking, What trial is more important than the
greatest play in history?
 The next performance was only Grandma again. She cried at all the wrong times and
cracked up at all the wrong times. She applauded when the audience found out the news
that Ophelia drowned, which is supposed to be bad news, and she booed when Hamlet
scored his first point in the duel against Laertes at the end, which is good, for obvious reasons.

'This is where his lips were that I used to kiss a lot. Where are your jokes now, your games,
your songs?'
Backstage, before closing night, Jimmy Snyder imitated Grandma to the rest of the cast
and crew. I guess I hadn't realized how loud she was. I had gotten so angry at myself for
noticing her, but I was wrong, it was her fault. Everyone noticed. Jimmy did her exactly
right – the way she swatted her left hand at something funny, like there was a fly in front
of her face. The way she tilted her head, like she was concentrating incredibly hard on
something, and how she sneezed and told herself, 'God bless me.' And how she cried and
said, 'That's sad,' so everyone could hear it.
I sat there while he made all the kids crack up. Even Mrs. Rigley cracked up, and so did
her husband, who played the piano during the set changes. I didn't mention that she was
my grandma, and I didn't tell him to stop. Outside, I was cracking up too. Inside, I was
wishing that she were tucked away in a portable pocket, or that she'd also had an invisibility
suit. I wished the two of us could go somewhere far away, like the Sixth Borough.
68
She was there again that night, in the back row, although only the first three rows were
taken. I watched her from under the skull. She had her hand pressed against her ultraviolet
heart, and I could hear her saying, 'That's sad. That's so sad.' I thought about the unfinished
scarf, and the rock she carried across Broadway, and how she had lived so much life
but still needed imaginary friends, and the one thousand thumb wars.
MARGIE CARSON:
Hey, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
JIMMY SNYDER:
At Supper.
MARGIE CARSON:
At supper! Where?
JIMMY SNYDER:
Not where he eats, but where he's eaten.
MARGIE CARSON:
Wow!
JIMMY SNYDER:
A king can end up going through the guts of a beggar.
I felt, that night, on that stage, under that skull, incredibly close to everything in the universe,
but also extremely alone. I wondered, for the first time in my life, if life was worth
all the work it took to live. What exactly made it worth it? What's so horrible about being
dead forever, and not feeling anything, and not even dreaming? What's so great about
feeling and dreaming?
Jimmy put his hand under my face. 'This is where his lips were that I used to kiss a lot.
Where are your jokes now, your games, your songs?'
Maybe it was because of everything that had happened in those twelve weeks. Or maybe
it was because I felt so close and alone that night. I just couldn't be dead any longer.
ME:
Alas, poor Hamlet [I take JIMMY SNYDER's face into my hand] I knew him, Horatio.
JIMMY SNYDER:
But YorickÃ¢Â€Â¦you're onlyÃ¢Â€Â¦a skull.
ME:
So what? I don't care. Screw you.
JIMMY SNYDER:
[whispers] This is not in the play. [He looks for help from MRS. RIGLEY, who is in the
front row, flipping through the script. She draws circles in the air with her right hand,
which is the universal sign for 'improvise.']
ME:
I knew him, Horatio; a jerk of infinite stupidity, a most excellent masturbator in the sec-
69
ond-floor boys' bathroom – I have proof. Also, he's dyslexic.
JIMMY SNYDER:
[Can't think of anything to say]
ME:
Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs?
JIMMY SNYDER:
What are you talking about?
ME:
[Raises hand to scoreboard] Succotash my cocker spaniel, you fudging crevasse-hole dipshiitake!

JIMMY SNYDER:
Huh?
ME:
You are guilty of having abused those less strong than you: of making the lives of nerds
like me and Toothpaste and The Minch almost impossible, of imitating mental retards, of
prank-calling people who get almost no phone calls anyway, of terrorizing domesticated
animals and old people – who, by the way, are smarter and more knowledgeable than you
– of making fun of me just because I have a pussyÃ¢Â€Â¦And I've seen you litter, too.
JIMMY SNYDER:
I never prank-called any retards.
ME:
You were adopted.
JIMMY SNYDER:
[Searches audience for his parents]
ME:
And nobody loves you.
JIMMY SNYDER:
[His eyes fill with tears]
ME:
And you have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
JIMMY SNYDER:
Huh?
ME:
On behalf of the deadÃ¢Â€Â¦[I pull the skull off my head. Even though it's made of papiermâché
it's really hard. I smash it against JIMMY SNYDER's head, and I smash it again. He falls
to the ground, because he is unconscious, and I can't believe how strong I actually am. I smash his
head again with all my force and blood starts to come out of his nose and ears. But I still don 't feel
any sympathy for him. I want him to bleed, because he deserves it. And nothing else makes any
70
sense. DAD doesn't make sense. MOM doesn't make sense. THE AUDIENCE doesn't make sense.
The folding chairs and fog-machine fog don't make sense. Shakespeare doesn't make sense. The stars
that I know are on the other side of the gym ceiling don't make sense. The only thing that makes any
sense right then is my smashing JIMMY SNYDER's face. His blood. I knock a bunch of his teeth
into his mouth, and I think they go down his throat. There is blood everywhere, covering everything.
I keep smashing the skull against his skull, which is also RON's skull (for letting MOM get
on with life) and MOM's skull (for getting on with life) and DAD's skull (for dying) and
GRANDMA's skull (for embarrassing me so much) and DR. FEIN's skull (for asking if any good
could come out of DAD's death) and the skulls of everyone else I know. THE AUDIENCE is applauding,
all of them, because I am making so much sense. They are giving me a standing ovation
as I hit him again and again. I hear them call]
THE AUDIENCE:
Thank you! Thank you, Oskar! We love you so much! We'll protect you!
It would have been great.
I looked out across the audience from underneath the skull, with Jimmy's hand under my
chin. 'Alas, poor Yorick.' I saw Abe Black, and he saw me. I knew that we were sharing
something with our eyes, but I didn't know what, and I didn't know if it mattered.
It was twelve weekends earlier that I'd gone to visit Abe Black in Coney Island. I'm very
idealistic, but I knew I couldn't walk that far, so I took a cab. Even before we were out of
Manhattan, I realized that the $7.68 in my wallet wasn't going to be enough. I don't know
if you'd count it as a lie or not that I didn't say anything. It's just that I knew I had to get
there, and there was no alternative. When the cab driver pulled over in front of the building,
the meter said $76.50. I said, 'Mr. Mahaltra, are you an optimist or a pessimist?' He
said, 'What?' I said, 'Because unfortunately I only have seven dollars and sixty-eight cents.'
'Seven dollars?'
'And sixty-eight cents.'
'This is not happening.'
'Unfortunately, it is. But if you give me your address, I promise I'll send you the rest.' He
put his head down on the steering wheel. I asked if he was OK. He said, 'Keep your seven
dollars and sixty-eight cents.' I said, 'I promise I'll send you the money. I promise.' He
handed me his card, which was actually the card of a dentist, but he had written his address
on the other side. Then he said something in some other language that wasn't
French. 'Are you mad at me?'
Obviously I'm incredibly panicky about roller coasters, but Abe convinced me to ride one
with him. 'It would be a shame to die without riding the Cyclone,' he told me. 'It would be
a shame to die,' I told him. 'Yeah,' he said, 'but with the Cyclone you can choose.' We sat in
the front car, and Abe lifted his hands in the air on the downhill parts. I kept wondering if
what I was feeling was at all like falling.
In my head, I tried to calculate all of the forces that kept the car on the tracks and me in the
car. There was gravity, obviously. And centrifugal force. And momentum. And the friction
between the wheels and the tracks. And wind resistance, I think, or something. Dad used
to teach me physics with crayons on paper tablecloths while we waited for our pancakes.
71
He would have been able to explain everything.
The ocean smelled weird, and so did the food they were selling on the boardwalk, like
funnel cakes and cotton candy and hot dogs. It was an almost perfect day, except that Abe
didn't know anything about the key or about Dad. He said he was driving into Manhattan
and could give me a ride if I wanted one. I told him, 'I don't get in cars with strangers, and
how did you know I was going to Manhattan?' He said, 'We're not strangers, and I don't
know how I knew.'
'Do you have an SUV?'
'No.'
'Good. Do you have a gas-electric hybrid car?'
'No.'
'Bad.'
While we were in the car I told him all about how I was going to meet everyone in New
York with the last name Black. He said, 'I can relate, in my own way, because I had a dog
run away once. She was the best dog in the world. I couldn't have loved her more or
treated her better. She didn't want to run away. She just got confused, and followed one
thing and then another.'
'But my dad didn't run away,' I said. 'He was killed in a terrorist attack.' Abe said, 'I was
thinking of you.' He went up with me to the door of Ada Black's apartment, even though I
told him I could do it myself. 'I'll feel better knowing you made it here safely,' he said,
which sounded like Mom.
Ada Black owned two Picasso paintings. She didn't know anything about the key, so the
paintings meant nothing to me, even if I knew they were famous. She said I could have a
seat on the couch if I wanted to, but I told her I didn't believe in leather, so I stood. Her
apartment was the most amazing apartment I'd ever been in. The floors were like marble
chessboards, and the ceilings were like cakes. Everything seemed like it belonged in a museum,
so I took some pictures with Grandpa's camera. 'This might be a rude question, but
are you the richest person in the world?' She touched a lampshade and said, 'I'm the 467thrichest
person in the world.'
I asked her how it made her feel to know that there were homeless people and millionaires
living in the same city. She said, 'I give a lot to charity, if that's what you're getting at.' I
told her that I wasn't getting at anything, and that I just wanted to know how she felt. 'I
feel fine,' she said, and she asked me if I wanted something to drink. I asked her for a coffee,
and she asked someone in another room for a coffee, and then I asked her if she
thought that maybe no one should have more than a certain amount of money until everyone
had that amount of money. That was an idea Dad had once suggested to me. She
said, 'The Upper West Side isn't free, you know.' I asked her how she knew that I lived on
the Upper West Side. 'Do you have things that you don't need?'
'Not really.'
'You collect coins?'
'How did you know I collect coins?'
72
'Lots of young people collect coins.' I told her, 'I need them.'
'Do you need them as much as a homeless person needs food?' The conversation was beginning
to make me feel self-conscious. She said, 'Do you have more things that you need,
or more that you don't need?' I said, 'It depends on what it means to need.'
She said, 'Believe it or not, I used to be idealistic.' I asked her what 'idealistic' meant. 'It
means you live by what you think is right.'
'You don't do that anymore?'
'There are questions I don't ask anymore.' An African-American woman brought me coffee
on a silver tray. I told her, 'Your uniform is incredibly beautiful.' She looked at Ada.
'Really,' I said. 'I think light blue is a very, very beautiful color on you.' She was still looking
at Ada, who said, 'Thanks, Gail.' As she walked back to the kitchen I told her, 'Gail is a
beautiful name.'
When it was just the two of us again, Ada told me, 'Oskar, I think you made Gail feel quite
uncomfortable.'
'What do you mean?'
'I could tell that she felt embarrassed.'
'I was just trying to be nice.'
'You might have tried too hard.'
'How can you try too hard to be nice?'
'You were being condescending.'
'What's that?'
'You were talking to her like she was a child.'
'No I wasn't.'
'There's no shame in being a maid. She does a serious job, and I pay her well.' I said, 'I was
just trying to be nice.' And then I wondered, Did I tell her my name was Oskar?
 We sat there for a while. She stared out the window, like she was waiting for something
to happen in Central Park. I asked, 'Would it be OK if I snooped around your apartment?'
She laughed and said, 'Finally someone says what he's thinking.' I looked around a bit,
and there were so many rooms that I wondered if the apartment's inside was bigger than
its outside. But I didn't find any clues. When I came back she asked if I wanted a finger
sandwich, which freaked me out, but I was very polite and just said, 'Jose.'
'Pardon?'
'Jose.'
'I'm sorry. I don't understand what that means.'
'Jose. As in, 'No wayÃ¢Â€Â¦' She said, 'I know what I am.' I nodded my head, even
though I didn't know what she was talking about or what it had to do with anything.
'Even if I don't like what I am, I know what I am. My children like what they are, but they
don't know what they are. So tell me which is worse.'
'What are the options again?' She cracked up and said, 'I like you.'
73
I showed her the key, but she had never seen it, and couldn't tell me anything about it.
Even though I told her I didn't need any help, she made the doorman promise to put me in
a cab. I told her I couldn't afford a cab. She said, 'I can.' I gave her my card. She said, 'Good
luck,' and put her hands on my cheeks, and kissed the top of my head.
That was Saturday, and it was depressing.

New York Chapter
This might be hard to believe, but the next Black lived in our building, just one floor above
us. If it weren't my life, I wouldn't have believed it. I went to the lobby and asked Stan
what he knew about the person who lived in 6A. He said, 'Never seen anyone go in or
come out. Just a lot of deliveries and a lot of trash.'
'Cool.' He leaned down and whispered, 'Haunted.' I whispered back, 'I don't believe in the
paranormal.' He said, 'Ghosts don't care if you believe in them,' and even though I was an
atheist, I knew he wasn't right.
I walked back up the steps, this time past our floor and to the sixth. There was a mat in
front of the door which said Welcome in twelve different languages. That didn't seem like
something a ghost would put in front of his apartment. I tried the key in the lock, but it
didn't work, so I rang the buzzer, which was exactly where our buzzer was. I heard some
noise inside, and maybe even some creepy music, but I was brave and just stood there.
After an incredibly long time the door opened. 'Can I help you!' an old man asked, but he
asked it extremely loudly, so it was more like a scream. 'Yes, hello,' I said. 'I live downstairs
in 5A. May I please ask you a few questions?'
'Hello, young man!' he said, and he was kind of weird-looking, because he had on a red
beret, like a French person, and an eye patch, like a pirate. He said, 'I'm Mr. Black!' I said, 'I
know.' He turned around and started walking into his apartment. I guessed I was supposed
to follow him, so I did.
Another thing that was weird was that his apartment looked exactly like our apartment.
The floors were the same, the windowsills were the same, even the tiles on the fireplace
were the same color green. But his apartment was also incredibly different, because it was
filled with different stuff. Tons of stuff. Stuff everywhere. Also, there was a huge column
right in the middle of the dining room. It was as big as two refrigerators, and it made it
impossible for the room to have a table or anything else in it, like ours did. 'What's that
for?' I asked, but he didn't hear me. There were a bunch of dolls and other things on the
74
mantel, and the floors were filled with little rugs. 'I got those in Iceland!' he said, pointing
at the seashells on the windowsill. He pointed at a sword on the wall and said, 'I got that
in Japan!' I asked him if it was a samurai sword. He said, 'It's a replica!' I said, 'Cool.'
He led me to the kitchen table, which was where our kitchen table was, and he sat down
and slapped his hand against his knee. 'Well!' he said, so loudly that I wanted to cover my
ears. 'I've had a pretty amazing life!' I thought it was weird that he said that, because I
didn't ask him about his life. I didn't even tell him why I was there. 'I was born on January
1, 1900! I lived every day of the twentieth century!'
'Really?'
'My mother altered my birth certificate so I could fight in the First World War! That was
the only lie she ever told! I was engaged to Fitzgerald's sister!'
'Who's Fitzgerald?'
'Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, my boy! A Great Author! A Great Author!'
'Oops.'
'I used to sit on her porch and talk to her father while she powdered her nose upstairs! Her
father and I had the most lively conversations! He was a Great Man, like Winston Churchill
was a Great Man!' I decided that it would be better to Google Winston Churchill
when I got home, instead of mentioning that I didn't know who he was. 'One day, she
came downstairs and was ready to go! I told her to hold on for a minute, because her father
and I were right smack in the middle of a terrific conversation, and you can't interrupt
a terrific conversation, right!'
'I don't know.'
'Later that night, as I was dropping her off on that same porch, she said, 'Sometimes I
wonder if you like my father more than me!' I inherited that damn honesty from my
mother, and it caught up with me again! I told her, 'I do!' Well, that was the last time I told
her 'I do,' if you know what I mean!'
'I don't.'
'I blew it! Boy, did I blow it!' He started cracking up extremely loudly, and he slapped his
knee. I said, 'That's hilarious,' because it must have been for him to crack up so much. 'Hilarious!'
he said. 'It is! I never heard from her again! Oh, well! So many people enter and
leave your life! Hundreds of thousands of people! You have to keep the door open so they
can come in! But it also means you have to let them go!'
He put a teakettle on the stove.
'You're wise,' I told him. 'I've had enough time to get wise! See this!' he hollered, and he
flipped up his eye patch. 'That's from Nazi shrapnel! I was a war correspondent and ended
up attaching myself to a British tank corps going up the Rhine! We were ambushed one
afternoon, toward the end of '44! I bled my eye all over the page I was writing on, but
those sons of bitches couldn't stop me! I finished my sentence!'
'What was the sentence?'
'Ah, who can remember! The point is I wasn't going to let those bastard Krauts stop my
pen! It's mightier than the sword, you know! And the MG34!'
75
'Could you please put the patch back?'
'See that!' he said, pointing at the kitchen floor, but I couldn't stop thinking about his eye.
'There's oak under those rugs! Quarter-sawn oak! I should know, I laid it myself!'
'Jose,' I said, and I wasn't just saying it to be nice. I was keeping a list in my head of things
I could do to be more like him. 'My wife and I renovated this kitchen ourselves! With these
hands!' He showed me his hands. They looked like the hands on the skeleton in the Rainier
Scientific catalogue that Ron offered to buy for me, except they had skin, blotchy skin,
and I didn't want gifts from Ron. 'Where's your wife now?' The teakettle started to whistle.
'Oh,' he said, 'she died twenty-four years ago! Long time ago! Yesterday, in my life!'
'Oops.'
'It's OK!'
'You don't feel bad that I asked about her? You can tell me if you do.'
'No!' he said. 'Thinking about her is the next best thing!' He poured two cups of tea. 'Do
you have any coffee?' I asked. 'Coffee!'
'It stunts my growth, and I'm afraid of death.' He slapped the table and said, 'My boy, I
have some coffee from Honduras that's got your name on it!'
'But you don't even know my name.'
We sat around for a while and he told me more about his amazing life. As far as he knew,
which seemed pretty far, he was the only person still alive who had fought in both of the
world wars. He'd been to Australia, and Kenya, and Pakistan, and Panama. I asked him, 'If
you had to guess, how many countries would you guess you've been to?' He said, 'I
wouldn't have to guess! One hundred twelve!'
'Are there even that many countries?' He told me, 'There are more places you haven't
heard of than you've heard of!' I loved that. He had reported almost every war of the
twentieth century, like the Spanish Civil War, and the genocide in East Timor, and bad
stuff that happened in Africa. I hadn't heard of any of them, so I tried to remember them
so I could Google them when I got home. The list in my head was getting incredibly long:
Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, powdering her nose, Churchill, Mustang convertible, Walter
Cronkite, necking, the Bay of Pigs, LP, Datsun, Kent State, lard, Ayatollah Khomeini, Polaroid,
apartheid, drive-in, favela, Trotsky, the Berlin Wall, Tito, Gone With the Wind, Frank
Lloyd Wright, hula hoop, Technicolor, the Spanish Civil War, Grace Kelly, East Timor,
slide rule, a bunch of places in Africa whose names I tried to remember but had already
forgotten. It was getting hard to keep all the things I didn't know inside me.
His apartment was filled with the stuff he'd collected during the wars of his life, and I took
pictures of them with Grandpa's camera. There were books in foreign languages, and little
statues, and scrolls with pretty paintings, and Coke cans from around the world, and a
bunch of rocks on his fireplace mantel, although all of them were common. One fascinating
thing was that each rock had a little piece of paper next to it that said where the rock
came from, and when it came from, like, 'Normandy, 6/19/44,' 'Hwach'on Dam, 4/09/51,'
and 'Dallas, 11/22/63.' That was so fascinating, but one weird thing was that there were
lots of bullets on the mantel, too, and they didn't have little pieces of paper next to them. I
asked him how he knew which was which. 'A bullet's a bullet's a bullet!' he said. 'But isn't
76
a rock a rock?' I asked. He said, 'Of course not!' I thought I understood him, but I wasn't
positive, so I pointed at the roses in the vase on the table. 'Is a rose a rose?'
'No! A rose is not a rose is not a rose!' And then for some reason I started thinking about
'Something in the Way She Moves,' so I asked, 'Is a love song a love song?' He said, 'Yes!' I
thought for a second. 'Is love love?' He said, 'No!' He had a wall of masks from every
country he'd been to, like Armenia and Chile and Ethiopia. 'It's not a horrible world,' he
told me, putting a Cambodian mask on his face, 'but it's filled with a lot of horrible people!'

I had another cup of coffee, and then I knew it was time to get to the point, so I took the
key off my neck and gave it to him. 'Do you know what this opens?'
'Don't think so!' he hollered. 'Maybe you knew my dad?'
'Who was your dad!'
'His name was Thomas Schell. He lived in 5A until he died.'
'No,' he said, 'that name doesn't ring a bell!' I asked if he was one-hundred-percent sure.'
He said, 'I've lived long enough to know I'm not one-hundred-percent anything!' and he
got up, walked past the column in the dining room, and went over to the coat closet,
which was tucked under the stairs. That was when I had the revelation that his apartment
wasn't just like ours, because his had an upstairs. He opened the closet, and there was a
library card catalogue inside. 'Cool.'
He said, 'This is my biographical index!'
'Your what?'
'I started it when I was just beginning to write! I'd create a card for everyone I thought I
might need to reference one day! There's a card for everyone I ever wrote about! And
cards for people I talked to in the course of writing my pieces! And cards for people I read
books about! And cards for people in the footnotes of those books! In the mornings, when
I'd read the papers, I would make cards for everyone that seemed biographically significant!
I still do it!'
'Why don't you just use the Internet?'
'I don't have a computer!' That made me start to feel dizzy.
'How many cards do you have?'
'I've never counted! There must be tens of thousands by this point! Maybe hundreds of
thousands!'
'What do you write on them?'
'I write the name of the person and a one-word biography!'
'Just one word?'
'Everyone gets boiled down to one word!'
'And that's helpful?'
'It's hugely helpful! I read an article about Latin American currencies this morning! It referred
to the work of someone named Manuel Escobar! So I came and looked up Escobar!
Sure enough, he was in here! Manuel Escobar: unionist!'
77
'But he's also probably a husband, or dad, or Beatles fan, or jogger, or who knows what
else.'
'Sure! You could write a book about Manuel Escobar! And that would leave things out,
too! You could write ten books! You could never stop writing!'
He slid out drawers from the cabinet and pulled cards from the drawers, one after another.

'Henry Kissinger: war!
'Ornette Coleman: music!
'Che Guevara: war!
'Jeff Bezos: money!
'Philip Guston: art!
'Mahatma Gandhi: war!'
'But he was a pacifist,' I said.
'Right! War!
'Arthur Ashe: tennis!
'Tom Cruise: money!
'Elie Wiesel: war!
'Arnold Schwarzenegger: war!
'Martha Stewart: money!
'Rem Koolhaas: architecture!
'Ariel Sharon: war!
'Mick Jagger: money!
'Yasir Arafat: war!
'Susan Sontag: thought!
'Wolfgang Puck: money!
'Pope John Paul II: war!'
I asked if he had a card for Stephen Hawking.
'Of course!' he said, and slid out a drawer, and pulled out a card.
STEPHEN HAWKING: ASTROPHYSICS
'Do you have a card for yourself?' He slid out a drawer.
A. R. BLACK: WAR
 HUSBAND
'So do you have a card for my dad?'
'Thomas Schell, right!'
'Right.' He went to the S drawer and pulled it halfway out. His fingers ran through the
cards like the fingers of someone much younger than 103.
'Sorry! Nothing!'
78
'Could you double-check?' His fingers ran through the cards again. He shook his head.
'Sorry!'
'Well, what if a card is filed in the wrong place?'
'Then we've got a problem!'
'Could it be?'
'It happens occasionally! Marilyn Monroe was lost in the index for more than a decade! I
kept checking under Norma Jean Baker, thinking I was smart, but completely forgetting
that she was born Norma Jean Mortenson!'
'Who's Norma Jean Mortenson?'
'Marilyn Monroe!'
'Who's Marilyn Monroe?'
'Sex!'
'Do you have a card for Mohammed Atta?'
'Atta! That one rings a bell! Lemme see!' He opened the A drawer. I told him, 'Mohammed
is the most common name on earth.' He pulled out a card and said, 'Bingo!'
MOHAMMED ATTA: WAR
I sat down on the floor. He asked what was wrong. 'It's just that why would you have one
for him and not one for my dad?'
'What do you mean!'
'It isn't fair.'
'What isn't fair!'
'My dad was good. Mohammed Atta was evil.'
'So!'
'So my dad deserves to be in there.'
'What makes you think it's good to be in here!'
'Because it means you're biographically significant.'
'And why is that good!'
'I want to be significant.'
'Nine out of ten significant people have to do with money or war!'
But still, it gave me heavy, heavy boots. Dad wasn't a Great Man, not like Winston Churchill,
whoever he was. Dad was just someone who ran a family jewelry business. Just an
ordinary dad. But I wished so much, then, that he had been Great. I wished he'd been famous,
famous like a movie star, which is what he deserved. I wished Mr. Black had written
about him, and risked his life to tell the world about him, and had reminders of him
around his apartment.
I started thinking: if Dad were boiled down to one word, what would that word be? Jeweler?
Atheist? Is copyeditor one word?
'You're looking for something!' Mr. Black asked. 'This key used to belong to my dad,' I
79
said, pulling it out from under my shirt again, 'and I want to know what it opens.' He
shrugged his shoulders and hollered, 'I'd want to know, too!' Then we were silent for a
while.
I thought I was going to cry, but I didn't want to cry in front of him, so I asked where the
bathroom was. He pointed to the top of the stairs. As I walked up, I held the railing tight
and started inventing things in my head: air bags for skyscrapers, solar-powered limousines
that never had to stop moving, a frictionless, perpetual yo-yo. The bathroom smelled
like an old person, and some of the tiles that were supposed to be on the wall were on the
floor. There was a photograph of a woman tucked in the corner of the mirror above the
sink. She was sitting at the kitchen table that we were just sitting at, and she was wearing
an enormous hat, even though she was inside, obviously. That's how I knew that she was
special. One of her hands was on a teacup. Her smile was incredibly beautiful. I wondered
if her palm was sweating condensation when the picture was taken. I wondered if Mr.
Black took the picture.
Before I went back down, I snooped around a little bit. I was impressed by how much life
Mr. Black had lived, and how much he wanted to have his life around him. I tried the key
in all of the doors, even though he said he didn't recognize it. It's not that I didn't trust
him, because I did. It's that at the end of my search I wanted to be able to say: I don't know
how I could have tried harder. One door was to a closet, which didn't have anything really
interesting in it, just a bunch of coats. Behind another door was a room filled with boxes. I
took the lids off a couple of them, and they were filled with newspapers. The newspapers
in some of the boxes were yellow, and some were almost like leaves.
I looked in another room, which must have been his bedroom. There was the most amazing
bed I've ever seen, because it was made out of tree parts. The legs were stumps, the
ends were logs, and there was a ceiling of branches. Also there were all sorts of fascinating
metal things glued to it, like coins, pins, and a button that said ROOSEVELT.
'That used to be a tree in the park!' Mr. Black said from behind me, which scared me so
much that my hands started shaking. I asked, 'Are you mad at me for snooping?' but he
must not have heard me, because he kept talking. 'By the reservoir. She tripped on its roots
once! That was back when I was courting her! She fell down and cut her hand! A little cut,
but I never forgot it! That was so long ago!'
'But yesterday in your life, right?'
'Yesterday! Today! Five minutes ago! Now!' He aimed his eyes at the ground. 'She always
begged me to give the reporting a break! She wanted me at home!' He shook his head and
said, 'But there were things I needed, too!' He looked at the floor, then back at me. I asked,
'So what did you do?'
'For most of our marriage I treated her as though she didn't matter! I came home only between
wars, and left her alone for months at a time! There was always war!'
'Did you know that in the last 3,500 years there have been only 230 years of peace
throughout the civilized world?' He said, 'You tell me which 230 years and I'll believe
you!'
'I don't know which, but I know it's true.'
80
'And where's this civilized world you're referring to!'
I asked him what happened to make him stop reporting war. He said, 'I realized that what
I wanted was to stay in one place with one person!'
'So you came home for good?'
'I chose her over war! And the first thing I did when I came back, even before I went home,
was to go to the park and cut down that tree! It was the middle of the night! I thought
someone would try to stop me, but no one did! I brought the pieces home with me! I made
that tree into this bed! It was the bed we shared for the last years we had together! I wish
I'd understood myself better earlier!' I asked, 'Which was your last war?' He said, 'Cutting
down that tree was my last war!' I asked him who won, which I thought was a nice question,
because it would let him say that he won, and feel proud. He said, 'The ax won! It's
always that way!'
He went up to the bed and put his finger on the head of a nail. 'See these!' I try to be a perceptive
person who follows the scientific method and is observant, but I hadn't noticed before
that the whole bed was completely covered in nails. 'I've hammered a nail into the
bed every morning since she died! It's the first thing I do after waking! Eight thousand six
hundred twenty-nine nails!' I asked him why, which I thought was another nice question,
because it would let him tell me about how much he loved her. He said, 'I don't know!' I
said, 'But if you don't know, then why do you do it?'
'I suppose it helps! Keeps me going! I know it's nonsense!'
'I don't think it's nonsense.'
'Nails aren't light! One is! A handful are! But they add up!' I told him, 'The average human
body contains enough iron to make a one-inch nail.' He said, 'The bed got heavy! I could
hear the floor straining, like it was in pain! Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the
night afraid that everything would go crashing to the apartment below!'
'You couldn't sleep because of me.'
'So I built that column downstairs! Do you know about the library at Indiana University!'
'No,' I said, but I was still thinking about the column. 'It's sinking a little more than an inch
a year, because when they built it, they didn't take into account the weight of all of the
books! I wrote a piece about it! I didn't make the connection then, but now I'm thinking of
Debussy's Sunken Cathedral, one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written! I haven't
heard it in years and years! Do you want to feel something!'
'OK,' I said, because even though I didn't know him, I felt like I knew him. 'Open your
hand!' he said, so I did. He reached into his pocket and took out a paper clip. He pressed it
into my hand and said, 'Make a fist around it!' So I did. 'Now extend your hand!' I extended
my hand. 'Now open your hand!' The paper clip flew to the bed.
It was only then that I observed that the key was reaching toward the bed. Because it was
relatively heavy, the effect was small. The string pulled incredibly gently at the back of my
neck, while the key floated just a tiny bit off my chest. I thought about all the metal buried
in Central Park. Was it being pulled, even if just a little, to the bed? Mr. Black closed his
hand around the floating key and said, 'I haven't left the apartment in twenty-four years!'
81
'What do you mean?'
'Sadly, my boy, I mean exactly what I said! I haven't left the apartment in twenty-four
years! My feet haven't touched the ground!'
'Why not?'
'There hasn't been any reason to!'
'What about stuff you need?'
'What does someone like me need that he can still get!'
'Food. Books. Stuff.'
'I call in an order for food, and they bring it to me! I call the bookstore for books, the video
store for movies! Pens, stationery, cleaning supplies, medicine! I even order my clothes
over the phone!
See this!' he said, and he showed me his muscle, which went down instead of up. 'I was
flyweight champion for nine days!' I asked, 'Which nine days?' He said, 'Don't you believe
me!' I said, 'Of course I do.'
'The world is a big place,' he said, 'but so is the inside of an apartment! So's this!' he said,
pointing at his head. 'But you used to travel so much. You had so many experiences. Don't
you miss the world?'
'I do! Very much!'
My boots were so heavy that I was glad there was a column underneath us. How could
such a lonely person have been living so close to me my whole life? If I had known, I
would have gone up to keep him company. Or I would have made some jewelry for him.
Or told him hilarious jokes. Or given him a private tambourine concert.
It made me start to wonder if there were other people so lonely so close. I thought about
'Eleanor Rigby.' It's true, where do they all come from? And where do they all belong?
What if the water that came out of the shower was treated with a chemical that responded
to a combination of things, like your heartbeat, and your body temperature, and your
brain waves, so that your skin changed color according to your mood? If you were extremely
excited your skin would turn green, and if you were angry you'd turn red, obviously,
and if you felt like shiitake you'd turn brown, and if you were blue you'd turn blue.
Everyone could know what everyone else felt, and we could be more careful with each
other, because you'd never want to tell a person whose skin was purple that you're angry
at her for being late, just like you would want to pat a pink person on the back and tell
him, 'Congratulations!'
Another reason it would be a good invention is that there are so many times when you
know you're feeling a lot of something, but you don't know what the something is. Am I
frustrated? Am I actually just panicky? And that confusion changes your mood, it becomes
your mood, and you become a confused, gray person. But with the special water, you
could look at your orange hands and think, I'm happy! That whole time I was actually happy!
What a relief! Mr. Black said, 'I once went to report on a village in Russia, a community of
artists who were forced to flee the cities! I'd heard that paintings hung everywhere! I heard
you couldn't see the walls through all of the paintings! They'd painted the ceilings, the
82
plates, the windows, the lampshades! Was it an act of rebellion! An act of expression!
Were the paintings good, or was that beside the point! I needed to see it for myself, and I
needed to tell the world about it! I used to live for reporting like that! Stalin found out
about the community and sent his thugs in, just a few days before I got there, to break all
of their arms! That was worse than killing them! It was a horrible sight, Oskar: their arms
in crude splints, straight in front of them like zombies! They couldn't feed themselves, because
they couldn't get their hands to their mouths! So you know what they did!'
'They starved?'
'They fed each other! That's the difference between heaven and hell! In hell we starve! In
heaven we feed each other!'
'I don't believe in the afterlife.'
'Neither do I, but I believe in the story!'
And then, all of a sudden, I thought of something. Something enormous. Something wonderful.
'Do you want to help me?'
'Excuse me!'
'With the key.'
'Help you!'
'You could go around with me.'
'You want my help!'
'Yes.'
'Well, I don't need anyone's charity!'
'Jose,' I told him. 'You're obviously very smart and knowledgeable, and you know a ton of
things that I don't know, and also it's good just to have company, so please say yes.' He
closed his eyes and became quiet. I couldn't tell if he was thinking about what we were
talking about, or thinking about something else, or if maybe he'd fallen asleep, which I
know that old people, like Grandma, sometimes do, because they can't help it. 'You don't
have to make a decision right now,' I said, because I didn't want him to feel forced. I told
him about the 162 million locks, and how the search would probably take a long time, it
might even take the full one and a half years, so if he wanted to think about it for a while
that would be OK, he could just come downstairs and tell me his answer whenever. He
kept thinking. 'Take as long as you want,' I said. He kept thinking. I asked him, 'Do you
have a decision?'
He didn't say anything.
'What do you think, Mr. Black?'
Nothing.
'Mr. Black?'
I tapped him on the shoulder and he looked up suddenly.
'Hello?'
He smiled, like I do when Mom finds out about something I did that I shouldn't have
done.
83
'I've been reading your lips!'
'What?' He pointed at his hearing aids, which I hadn't noticed before, even though I was
trying as hard as I could to notice everything. 'I turned them off a long time ago!'
'You turned them off?'
'A long, long time ago!'
'On purpose?'
'I thought I'd save the batteries!'
'For what?' He shrugged his shoulders. 'But don't you want to hear things?' He shrugged
his shoulders again, in a way so I couldn't tell if he was saying yes or no. And then I
thought of something else. Something beautiful. Something true. 'Do you want me to turn
them on for you?'
He looked at me and through me at the same time, like I was a stained-glass window. I
asked again, moving my lips slowly and carefully so I could be sure he understood me:
'Do. You. Want. Me. To. Turn. Them. On. For. You?' He kept looking at me. I asked again.
He said, 'I don't know how to say yes!' I told him, 'You don't have to.'
I went behind him and saw a tiny dial on the back of each of his hearing aids.
'Do it slowly!' he said, almost like he was begging me. 'It's been a long, long time!'
I went back around to his front so he could see my lips, and I promised him I would be as
gentle as I could. Then I went back behind him and turned the dials extremely slowly, a
few millimeters at a time. Nothing happened. I turned them a few more millimeters. And
then just a few more. I went around to the front of him. He shrugged, and so did I. I went
back around behind him and turned them up just a tiny bit more, until they stopped. I
went back in front of him. He shrugged. Maybe the hearing aids didn't work anymore, or
maybe the batteries had died of old age, or maybe he'd gone completely deaf since he
turned them off, which was possible. We looked at each other.
Then, out of nowhere, a flock of birds flew by the window, extremely fast and incredibly
close. Maybe twenty of them. Maybe more. But they also seemed like just one bird, because
somehow they all knew exactly what to do. Mr. Black grabbed at his ears and made
a bunch of weird sounds. He started crying – not out of happiness, I could tell, but not out
of sadness, either.
'Are you OK?' I whispered.
The sound of my voice made him cry more, and he nodded his head yes.
I asked him if he wanted me to make some more noise.
He nodded yes, which shook more tears down his cheeks.
I went to the bed and rattled it, so that a bunch of the pins and paper clips fell off.
He cried more tears.
'Do you want me to turn them off?' I asked, but he wasn't paying attention to me anymore.
He was walking around the room, sticking his ears up to anything that made any noise,
including very quiet things, like pipes.
I wanted to stay there watching him hear the world, but it was getting late, and I had a
84
Hamlet rehearsal at 4:30, and it was an extremely important rehearsal, because it was the
first one with lighting effects. I told Mr. Black that I would pick him up the next Saturday
at 7:00, and we would start then. I told him, 'I'm not even through with the A's. He said,
'OK,' and the sound of his own voice made him cry the most.
Message three. 9:31 A.M.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
When Mom tucked me in that night, she could tell that something was on my mind, and
asked if I wanted to talk. I did, but not to her, so I said, 'No offense, but no.'
'Are you sure?'
'Tres fatigué,' I said, waving my hand. 'Do you want me to read something to you?'
'It's OK.'
'We could go through the New York Times for mistakes?'
'No, thank you.'
'All right,' she said, 'all right.' She gave me a kiss and turned off the light, and then, as she
was about to go, I said, 'Mom?' and she said, 'Yes?' and I said, 'Do you promise not to bury
me when I die?'
She came back over and put her hand on my cheek and said, 'You're not going to die.' I
told her, 'I am.' She said, 'You're not going to die any time soon. You have a long, long life
ahead of you.' I told her, 'As you know, I'm extremely brave, but I can't spend eternity in a
small underground place. I just can't. Do you love me?'
'Of course I love you.'
'Then put me in one of those mausoleum-thingies.'
'A mausoleum?'
'Like I read about.'
'Do we have to talk about this?'
'Yes.'
'Now?'
'Yes.'
'Why?'
'Because what if I die tomorrow?'
'You're not going to die tomorrow.'
'Dad didn't think he was going to die the next day.'
'That's not going to happen to you.'
'It wasn't going to happen to him.'
'Oskar.'
'I'm sorry, but I just can't be buried.'
'Don't you want to be with Dad and me?'
'Dad isn't even there!'
85
'Excuse me?'
'His body was destroyed.'
'Don't talk like that.'
'Talk like what? It's the truth. I don't understand why everyone pretends he's there.'
'Take it easy, Oskar.'
'It's just an empty box.'
'It's more than an empty box.'
'Why would I want to spend eternity next to an empty box?'
Mom said, 'His spirit is there,' and that made me really angry. I told her, 'Dad didn't have
a spirit! He had cells!'
'His memory is there.'
'His memory is here,' I said, pointing at my head. 'Dad had a spirit,' she said, like she was
rewinding a bit in our conversation. I told her, 'He had cells, and now they're on rooftops,
and in the river, and in the lungs of millions of people around New York, who breathe him
every time they speak!'
'You shouldn't say things like that.'
'But it's the truth! Why can't I say the truth!'
'You're getting out of control.'
'Just because Dad died, it doesn't mean you can be illogical, Mom.'
'Yes it does.'
'No it doesn't.'
'Get a hold of yourself, Oskar.'
'Fuck you!'
'Excuse me!'
'Sorry. I mean, screw you.'
'You need a time-out!'
'I need a mausoleum!'
'Oskar!'
'Don't lie to me!'
'Who's lying?'
'Where were you!'
'Where was I when?'
'That day!'
'What day?'
'The day!'
'What do you mean?'
'Where were you!'
86
'I was at work.'
'Why weren't you at home?'
'Because I have to go to work.'
'Why didn't you pick me up from school like the other moms?'
'Oskar, I came home as soon as I could. It takes longer for me to get home than for you to. I
thought it would be better to meet you at the apartment than make you wait at school for
me to get to you.'
'But you should have been home when I got home.'
'I wish I had been, but it wasn't possible.'
'You should have made it possible.'
'I can't make the impossible possible.'
'You should have.' She said, 'I got home as quickly as I could.' And then she started crying.
The ax was winning.
I put my cheek against her. 'I don't need anything fancy, Mom. Just something above
ground.' She took a deep breath, put her arm around me, and said, 'That might be possible.'
I tried to think of some way to be hilarious, because I thought that maybe if I was hilarious,
she wouldn't be mad at me anymore and I could be safe again. 'With a little elbow
room.'
'What?'
'I'm gonna need a little elbow room.' She smiled and said, 'OK.' I sniffled again, because I
could tell that it was working. 'And a bidet.'
'Absolutely. One bidet coming up.'
'And some electrical fencing.'
'Electrical fencing?'
'So that grave robbers won't try to steal all of my jewels.'
'Jewels?'
'Yeah,' I said, 'I'm gonna need some jewels, too.'
We cracked up together, which was necessary, because she loved me again. I pulled my
feelings book from under my pillow, flipped to the current page, and downgraded from
DESPERATE to MEDIOCRE. 'Hey, that's great!' Mom said, looking over my shoulder.
'No,' I said, 'it's mediocre. And please don't snoop.' She rubbed my chest, which was nice,
although I had to turn a little so she wouldn't feel that I still had my key on, and that there
were two keys.
'Mom?'
'Yes.'
'Nothing.'
'What is it, baby?'
'Well it's just that wouldn't it be great if mattresses had spaces for your arm, so that when
87
you rolled onto your side, you could fit just right?'
'That would be nice.'
'And good for your back, probably, because it would let your spine be straight, which I
know is important.'
'That is important.'
'Also, it would make snuggling easier. You know how that arm constantly gets in the
way?'
'I do.'
'And making snuggling easier is important.'
'Very.'
MEDIOCRE
OPTIMISTIC, BUT REALISTIC
'I miss Dad.'
'So do I.'
'Do you?'
'Of course I do.'
'But do you really?'
'How could you ask that?'
'It's just that you don't act like you miss him very much.'
'What are you talking about?'
'I think you know what I'm talking about.'
'I don't.'
'I hear you laughing.'
'You hear me laughing?'
'In the living room. With Ron.'
'You think because I laugh every now and then I don't miss Dad?' I rolled onto my side,
away from her.
OPTIMISTIC, BUT REALISTIC
 EXTREMELY DEPRESSED
She said, 'I cry a lot, too, you know.'
'I don't see you cry a lot.'
'Maybe that's because I don't want you to see me cry a lot.'
'Why not?'
'Because that isn't fair to either of us.'
'Yes it is.'
'I want us to move on.'
88
'How much do you cry?'
'How much?'
'A spoonful? A cup? A bathtub? If you added it up.'
'It doesn't work like that.'
'Like what?'
She said, 'I'm trying to find ways to be happy. Laughing makes me happy.' I said, 'I'm not
trying to find ways to be happy, and I won't.' She said, 'Well, you should.'
'Why?'
'Because Dad would want you to be happy.'
'Dad would want me to remember him.'
'Why can't you remember him and be happy?'
'Why are you in love with Ron?'
'What?'
'You're obviously in love with him, so what I want to know is, why? What's so great about
him?'
'Oskar, did it ever occur to you that things might be more complicated than they seem?'
'That occurs to me all the time.'
'Ron is my friend.'
'So then promise me you won't ever fall in love again.'
'Oskar, Ron is going through a lot, too. We help each other. We're friends.'
'Promise me you won't fall in love.'
'Why would you ask me to promise that?'
'Either promise me you'll never fall in love again, or I'm going to stop loving you.'
'You're not being fair.'
'I don't have to be fair! I'm your son!' She let out an enormous breath and said, 'You remind
me so much of Dad.' And then I said something that I wasn't planning on saying,
and didn't even want to say. As it came out of my mouth, I was ashamed that it was mixed
with any of Dad's cells that I might have inhaled when we went to visit Ground Zero. 'If I
could have chosen, I would have chosen you!'
She looked at me for a second, then stood up and walked out of the room. I wish she'd
slammed the door, but she didn't. She closed it carefully, like she always did. I could hear
that she didn't walk away.
EXTREMELY DEPRESSED
 INCREDIBLY ALONE
'Mom?' Nothing.
I got out of bed and went to the door.
'I take it back.'
89
She didn't say anything, but I could hear her breathing. I put my hand on the doorknob,
because I thought maybe her hand was on the doorknob on the other side.
'I said I take it back.'
'You can't take something like that back.'
'Can you apologize for something like that?'
Nothing.
'Do you accept my apology?'
'I don't know.'
'How can you not know?'
'Oskar, I don't know.'
'Are you mad at me?'
Nothing.
'Mom?'
'Yes.'
'Are you still mad at me?'
'No.'
'Are you sure?'
'I was never mad at you.'
'What were you?'
'Hurt.'
INCREDIBLY ALONE
 I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP ON THE FLOOR. WHEN I WOKE UP, MOM WAS
PULLING MY SHIRT OFF TO HELP ME GET INTO MY PJS, WHICH MEANS SHE
MUST HAVE SEEN ALL OF MY BRUISES. I COUNTED THEM LAST NIGHT IN
THE MIRROR AND THERE WERE FORTY-ONE. SOME OF THEM HAVE
GOTTEN BIG, BUT MOST OF THEM ARE SMALL. I DON'T PUT THEM THERE
FOR HER, BUT STILL I WANT HER TO ASK ME HOW I GOT THEM (EVEN
THOUGH SHE PROBABLY KNOWS), AND TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME (BECAUSE
SHE SHOULD REALIZE HOW HARD THINGS ARE FOR ME), AND TO FEEL
TERRIBLE (BECAUSE AT LEAST SOME OF IT IS HER FAULT), AND TO
PROMISE ME THAT SHE WON'T DIE AND LEAVE ME ALONE. BUT SHE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE LOOK IN HER EYES
WHEN SHE SAW THE BRUISES, BECAUSE MY SHIRT WAS OVER MY HEAD,
COVERING MY FACE LIKE A POCKET, OR A SKULL.
90
MY FEELINGS
 They are announcing flights over the speakers. We are not listening. They do not matter to
us, because we are not going anywhere. I miss you already, Oskar. I missed you even
when I was with you. That's been my problem. I miss what I already have, and I surround
myself with things that are missing.
Every time I put in a new page, I look at your grandfather. I am so relieved to see his face.
It makes me feel safe. His shoulders are pinched. His spine is curved. In Dresden he was a
giant. I'm glad that his hands are still rough. The sculptures never left them. I didn't notice
until now that he is still wearing his wedding ring. I wonder if he put it on when he came
back or if he wore it all those years. Before I came here I locked up the apartment. I turned
off the lights and made sure none of the faucets leaked. It's hard to say goodbye to the
place you've lived. It can be as hard as saying goodbye to a person. We moved in after we
were married. It had more room than his apartment. We needed it. We needed room for
all of the animals, and we needed room between us. Your grandfather bought the most
expensive insurance policy. A man from the company came over to take pictures. If anything
happened, they would be able to rebuild the apartment again exactly as it was. He
took a roll of film. He took a picture of the floor, a picture of the fireplace, a picture of the
bathtub. I never confused what I had with what I was. When the man left, your grandfather
took out his own camera and started taking more pictures. What are you doing? I
asked him.
Better safe than sorry, he wrote. At the time I thought he was right, but I am not sure
anymore.
He took pictures of everything. Of the undersides of the shelves in the closet. Of the backs
of the mirrors. Even the broken things. The things you would not want to remember. He
could have rebuilt the apartment by taping together the pictures.
And the doorknobs. He took a picture of every doorknob in the apartment. Every one. As
if the world and its future depended on each doorknob. As if we would be thinking about
doorknobs should we ever actually need to use the pictures of them. I don't know why
that hurt me so much. I told him, They are not even nice doorknobs. He wrote, But they
are our doorknobs. I was his too.
He never took pictures of me, and we didn't buy life insurance. He kept one set of the pictures
in his dresser. He taped another set into his daybooks, so they'd always be with him,
in case something happened at home.
Our marriage was not unhappy, Oskar. He knew how to make me laugh. And sometimes I
made him laugh. We had to make rules, but who doesn't. There is nothing wrong with
compromising. Even if you compromise almost everything.
He got a job at a jewelry store, because he knew the machines. He worked so hard that
they made him assistant manager, and then manager. He did not care about jewelry. He
hated it. He used to say jewelry is the opposite of sculpture. But it was a living, and he
promised me that was OK. We got our own store in a neighborhood that was next to a bad
neighborhood. It was open from eleven in the morning until six at night. But there was
91
always work to be done. We spent our lives making livings.
Sometimes he would go to the airport after work. I asked him to get me papers and magazines.
At first this was because I wanted to learn American expressions. But I gave up on
that. I still asked him to go. I knew that he needed my permission to go. It was not out of
kindness that I sent him. We tried so hard. We were always trying to help each other. But
not because we were helpless. He needed to get things for me, just as I needed to get
things for him. It gave us purpose. Sometimes I would ask him for something that I did
not even want, just to let him get it for me. We spent our days trying to help each other
help each other. I would get his slippers. He would make my tea. I would turn up the heat
so he could turn up the air conditioner so I could turn up the heat. His hands didn't lose
their roughness.
It was Halloween. Our first in the apartment. The doorbell rang.
Your grandfather was at the airport. I opened the door and a child was standing there in a
white sheet with holes cut out for her eyes. Trick or treat! she said. I took a step back.
Who is that?
I'm a ghost!
What are you wearing that for?
It's Halloween!
I don't know what that means.
Kids dress up and knock on doors, and you give them candy.
I don't have any candy.
It's Hal-lo-ween!
I told her to wait. I went to the bedroom. I took an envelope from underneath the mattress.
Our savings. Our living. I took out two one-hundred-dollar bills and put them in a different
envelope, which I gave to the ghost.
I was paying her to go away.
I closed the door and turned off the lights so no more children would ring our bell.
The animals must have understood, because they surrounded me and pressed into me. I
did not say anything when your grandfather came home that night. I thanked him for the
papers and magazines. I went to the guest room and pretended to write. I hit the space bar
again and again and again. My life story was spaces.
The days passed one at a time. And sometimes less than one at a time.
We looked at each other and drew maps in our heads. I told him my eyes were crummy,
because I wanted him to pay attention to me. We made safe places in the apartment where
you could go and not exist.
I would have done anything for him. Maybe that was my sickness. We made love in nothing
places and turned the lights off. It felt like crying. We could not look at each other. It
always had to be from behind. Like that first time. And I knew that he wasn't thinking of
me.
He squeezed my sides so hard, and pushed so hard. Like he was trying to push through
92
me to somewhere else. Why does anyone ever make love?
A year passed. Another year. Another year. Another. We made livings. I never forgot
about the ghost. I needed a child.
What does it mean to need a child?
One morning I awoke and understood the hole in the middle of me. I realized that I could
compromise my life, but not life after me. I couldn't explain it. The need came before explanations.
It was not out of weakness that I made it happen, but it was not out of strength
either. It was out of need. I needed a child. I tried to hide it from him. I tried to wait to tell
him until it was too late to do anything about it. It was the ultimate secret. Life. I kept it
safe inside me. I took it around. Like the apartment was inside his books. I wore loose
shirts. I sat with pillows on my lap. I was naked only in nothing places. But I could not
keep it a secret forever.
We were lying in bed in the darkness. I did not know how to say it. I knew, but I could not
say it. I took one of his daybooks from the bedside table.
The apartment had never been darker. I turned on the lamp. It became bright around us.
The apartment became darker. I wrote, I am pregnant. I handed it to him. He read it.
He took the pen and wrote, How could that have happened? I wrote, I made it happen. He
wrote, But we had a rule.
The next page was a doorknob.
I turned the page and wrote, I broke the rule.
He sat up in bed. I don't know how much time passed.
He wrote, Everything will be OK.
I told him OK wasn't enough.
Everything will be OK perfect.
I told him there was nothing left for a lie to protect.
Everything will be OK perfect.
I started to cry.
It was the first time I had ever cried in front of him. It felt like making love.
I asked him something I had needed to know since we made that first nothing place years
before. What are we? Something or nothing? He covered my face with his hands and lifted
them off. I did not know what that meant. The next morning I woke up with a terrible
cold. I did not know if the baby was making me sick or if your grandfather was.
When I said goodbye to him, before he left for the airport, I lifted his suitcase and it felt
heavy. That was how I knew he was leaving me.
I wondered if I should stop him. If I should wrestle him to the ground and force him to
love me. I wanted to hold his shoulders down and shout into his face. I followed him
there.
I watched him all morning. I did not know how to talk to him. I watched him write in his
book. I watched him ask people what time it was, although each person just pointed at the
big yellow clock on the wall.
93
It was so strange to see him from a distance. So small. I cared for him in the world as I
could not care for him in the apartment. I wanted to protect him from all of the terrible
things that no one deserves.
I got very close to him. Just behind him. I watched him write, It's a shame that we have to
live, but it's a tragedy that we get to live only one life. I stepped back. I could not be that
close. Not even then.
From behind a column I watched him write more, and ask for the time, and rub his rough
hands against his knees. Yes and No.
I watched him get in the line to buy tickets.
I wondered, When am I going to stop him from leaving?
I didn't know how to ask him or tell him or beg him.
When he got to the front of the line I went up to him.
I touched his shoulder.
I can see, I said. What a stupid thing to say. My eyes are crummy, but I can see.
What are you doing here? he wrote with his hands.
I felt suddenly shy. I was not used to shy. I was used to shame.
Shyness is when you turn your head away from something you want.
Shame is when you turn your head away from something you do not want.
I know you are leaving, I said.
You have to go home, he wrote. You should be in bed.
OK, I said. I did not know how to say what I needed to say.
Let me take you home.
No. I do not want to go home.
He wrote, You're being crazy. You're going to catch a cold.
I already have a cold.
You are going to catch a colder.
I could not believe he was making a joke. And I could not believe I laughed.
The laughter sent my thoughts to our kitchen table, where we would laugh and laugh.
That table was where we were close to each other.
It was instead of our bed. Everything in our apartment got confused.
We would eat on the coffee table in the living room instead of at the dining room table. We
wanted to be near the window. We filled the body of the grandfather clock with his empty
daybooks, as if they were time itself. We put his filled daybooks in the bathtub of the second
bathroom, because we never used it. I sleepwalk when I sleep at all.
Once I turned on the shower. Some of the books floated, and some stayed where they
were. When I awoke the next morning I saw what I had done. The water was gray with all
of his days. I am not being crazy, I told him. You have to go home.
I got tired, I told him. Not worn out, but worn through. Like one of those wives who
94
wakes up one morning and says I can't bake any more bread.
You never baked bread, he wrote, and we were still joking. Then it's like I woke up and
baked bread, I said, and we were joking even then. I wondered will there come a time
when we won't be joking? And what would that look like? And how would that feel?
When I was a girl, my life was music that was always getting louder. Everything moved
me. A dog following a stranger. That made me feel so much. A calendar that showed the
wrong month. I could have cried over it. I did. Where the smoke from a chimney ended.
How an overturned bottle rested at the edge of a table. I spent my life learning to feel less.
Every day I felt less.
Is that growing old? Or is it something worse? You cannot protect yourself from sadness
without protecting yourself from happiness.
He hid his face in the covers of his daybook, as if the covers were his hands. He cried. For
whom was he crying? For Anna? For his parents? For me? For himself?
I pulled the book from him. It was wet with tears running down the pages, as if the book
itself were crying. He hid his face in his hands. Let me see you cry, I told him.
I do not want to hurt you, he said by shaking his head left to right. It hurts me when you
do not want to hurt me, I told him. Let me see you cry. He lowered his hands. On one
cheek it said YES backward. On one cheek it said NO backward. He was still looking
down. Now the tears did not run down his cheeks, but fell from his eyes to the ground. Let
me see you cry, I said. I did not feel that he owed it to me. And I did not feel that I owed it
to him. We owed it to each other, which is something different. He raised his head and
looked at me. I am not angry with you, I told him. You must be.
I am the one who broke the rule.
But I am the one who made the rule you couldn't live with. My thoughts are wandering,
Oskar. They are going to Dresden, to my mother's pearls, damp with the sweat of her
neck. My thoughts are going up the sleeve of my father's overcoat. His arm was so thick
and strong. I was sure it would protect me for as long as I lived. And it did. Even after I
lost him. The memory of his arm wraps around me as his arm used to. Each day has been
chained to the previous one. But the weeks have had wings. Anyone who believes that a
second is faster than a decade did not live my life. Why are you leaving me? He wrote, I
do not know how to live. I do not know either, but I am trying. I do not know how to try.
There were things I wanted to tell him. But I knew they would hurt him. So I buried them,
and let them hurt me.
I put my hand on him. Touching him was always so important to me. It was something I
lived for. I never could explain why. Little, nothing touches. My fingers against his shoulder.
The outsides of our thighs touching as we squeezed together on the bus. I couldn't
explain it, but I needed it. Sometimes I imagined stitching all of our little touches together.
How many hundreds of thousands of fingers brushing against each other does it take to
make love? Why does anyone ever make love?
My thoughts are going to my childhood, Oskar. To when I was a girl. I am sitting here
thinking about fistfuls of pebbles, and the first time I noticed hairs under my arms.
My thoughts are around my mother's neck. Her pearls.
95
When I first liked the smell of perfume, and how Anna and I would lie in the darkness of
our bedroom, in the warmth of our bed.
I told her one night what I had seen behind the shed behind our house.
She made me promise never to speak a word about it. I promised her.
Can I watch you kiss?
Can you watch us kiss?
You could tell me where you are going to kiss, and I could hide and watch.
She laughed, which was how she said yes.
We woke up in the middle of the night. I do not know who woke up first. Or if we woke
up at the same time.
What does it feel like? I asked her.
What does what feel like?
To kiss.
She laughed.
It feels wet, she said.
I laughed.
It feels wet and warm and very strange at first.
I laughed.
Like this, she said, and she grabbed the sides of my face and pulled me into her.
I had never felt so in love in my life, and I have not felt so in love since.
We were innocent.
How could anything be more innocent than the two of us kissing in that bed?
How could anything less deserve to be destroyed?
I told him, I will try harder if you will stay.
OK, he wrote.
Just please do not leave me.
OK.
We never have to mention this.
OK.
I am thinking about shoes, for some reason. How many pairs I have worn in my life. And
how many times my feet have slipped into and out of them. And how I put them at the
foot of the bed, pointing away from the bed.
My thoughts are going down a chimney and burning. Footsteps above. Frying onions.
Clinking crystal. We were not rich, but there was nothing we wanted. From my bedroom
window I watched the world. And I was safe from the world. I watched my father fall
apart. The nearer the war came, the farther he went. Was that the only way he knew to
protect us? He spent hours in his shed every night. Sometimes he would sleep in there. On
the floor.
96
He wanted to save the world. That's what he was like. But he wouldn't put our family in
danger. That's what he was like. He must have weighed my life against a life he might
have been able to save. Or ten. Or one hundred. He must have decided that my life
weighed more than one hundred lives.
His hair turned gray that winter. I thought it was snow. He promised us that everything
would be OK. I was a child, but I knew that everything would not be OK. That did not
make my father a liar. It made him my father.
It was the morning of the bombing that I decided to write back to the forced laborer. I do
not know why I waited for so long, or what made me want to write to him then.
He had asked me to include a photograph of myself. I did not have any photographs of
myself that I liked. I understand, now, the tragedy of my childhood. It wasn't the bombing.
It was that I never once liked a photograph of myself. I couldn't.
I decided I would go to a photographer the next day and have a picture taken.
That night I tried on all of my outfits in front of the mirror. I felt like an ugly movie star. I
asked my mother to teach me about makeup. She didn't ask why.
She showed me how to rouge my cheeks. And how to paint my eyes. She had never
touched my face so much. There had never been an excuse to.
My forehead. My chin. My temples. My neck. Why was she crying?
I left the unfinished letter on my desk. The paper helped our house burn. I should have
sent it off with an ugly photograph. I should have sent off everything.
The airport was filled with people coming and going. But it was only your grandfather
and me.
I took his daybook and searched its pages. I pointed at, How frustrating, how pathetic,
how sad.
He searched through the book and pointed at, The way you just handed me that knife.
I pointed at, If I'd been someone else in a different world I'd've done something different.
He pointed at, Sometimes one simply wants to disappear. I pointed at, There's nothing
wrong with not understanding yourself. He pointed at, How sad.
I pointed at, And I wouldn't say no to something sweet. He pointed at, Cried and cried
and cried. I pointed at, Don't cry. He pointed at, Broken and confused. I pointed at, So sad.
He pointed at, Broken and confused. I pointed at, Something. He pointed at, Nothing. I
pointed at, Something. Nobody pointed at, I love you.
There was no way around it. We could not climb over it, or walk until we found its edge.
I regret that it takes a life to learn how to live, Oskar. Because if I were able to live my life
again, I would do things differently. I would change my life.
I would kiss my piano teacher, even if he laughed at me. I would jump with Mary on the
bed, even if I made a fool of myself. I would send out ugly photographs, thousands of
them.
What are we going to do? he wrote. It's up to you, I said. He wrote, I want to go home.
What is home to you? Home is the place with the most rules. I understood him.
97
And we will have to make more rules, I said. To make it more of a home. Yes. OK.
We went straight to the jewelry store. He left the suitcase in the back room. We sold a pair
of emerald earrings that day. And a diamond engagement ring. And a gold bracelet for a
little girl. And a watch for someone on his way to Brazil.
That night we held each other in bed. He kissed me all over. I believed him. I was not stupid.
I was his wife.
The next morning he went to the airport. I didn't dare feel his suitcase.
I waited for him to come home. Hours passed. And minutes. I didn't open the store at
11:00. I waited by the window. I still believed in him. I didn't eat lunch. Seconds passed.
The afternoon left. The evening came. I didn't eat dinner.
Years were passing through the spaces between moments. Your father kicked in my belly.
What was he trying to tell me? I brought the birdcages to the windows. I opened the windows,
and opened the birdcages. I poured the fish down the drain.
I took the dogs and cats downstairs and removed their collars. I released the insects onto
the street. And the reptiles.
And the mice.
I told them, Go.
All of you.
Go.
And they went.
And they didn't come back.
HAPPINESS, HAPPINESS
INTERVIEWER:
Can you describe the events of that morning?
TOMOYASU:
I left home with my daughter, Masako. She was on her way to work. I was going to see a
friend. An air-raid warning was issued. I told Masako I was going home. She said, 'I'm going
to the office.' I did chores and waited for the warning to be lifted.
I folded the bedding. I rearranged the closet. I cleaned the windows with a wet rag. There
was a flash. My first thought was that it was the flash from a camera. That sounds so ridiculous
now. It pierced my eyes. My mind went blank. The glass from the windows was
98
shattering all around me. It sounded like when my mother used to hush me to be quiet.
When I became conscious again, I realized I wasn't standing. I had been thrown into a different
room. The rag was still in my hand, but it was no longer wet. My only thought was
to find my daughter. I looked outside the window and saw one of my neighbors standing
almost naked. His skin was peeling off all over his body. It was hanging from his fingertips.
I asked him what had happened. He was too exhausted to reply. He was looking in
every direction, I can only assume for his family. I thought, I must go. I must go and find
Masako.
I put my shoes on and took my air-raid hood with me. I made my way to the train station.
So many people were marching toward me, away from the city. I smelled something similar
to grilled squid. I must have been in shock, because the people looked like squid washing
up on the shore.
I saw a young girl coming toward me. Her skin was melting down her. It was like wax.
She was muttering, 'Mother. Water. Mother. Water.' I thought she might be Masako. But
she wasn't. I didn't give her any water. I am sorry that I didn't. But I was trying to find my
Masako.
I ran all the way to Hiroshima Station. It was full of people. Some of them were dead.
Many of them were lying on the ground. They were calling for their mothers and asking
for water. I went to Tokiwa Bridge. I had to cross the bridge to get to my daughter's office.
INTERVIEWER:
Did you see the mushroom cloud?
TOMOYASU:
No, I didn't see the cloud.
INTERVIEWER:
You didn't see the mushroom cloud?
TOMOYASU:
I didn't see the mushroom cloud. I was trying to find Masako.
INTERVIEWER:
But the cloud spread over the city?
TOMOYASU:
I was trying to find her. They told me I couldn't go beyond the bridge. I thought she might
be back home, so I turned around. I was at the Nikitsu Shrine when the black rain started
falling from the sky. I wondered what it was.
INTERVIEWER:
Can you describe the black rain?
TOMOYASU:
I waited for her in the house. I opened the windows, even though there was no glass. I
stayed awake all night waiting. But she didn't come back. About 6:30 the next morning,
Mr. Ishido came around. His daughter was working at the same office as my daughter. He
called out asking for Masako's house. I ran outside. I called, 'It's here, over here!' Mr.
99
Ishido came up to me. He said, 'Quick! Get some clothes and go for her. She is at the bank
of the Ota River.' I ran as fast as I could. Faster than I was able to run. When I reached the
Tokiwa Bridge, there were soldiers lying on the ground. Around Hiroshima Station, I saw
more people lying dead. There were more on the morning of the seventh than on the sixth.
When I reached the riverbank, I couldn't tell who was who. I kept looking for Masako. I
heard someone crying, 'Mother!' I recognized her voice. I found her in horrible condition.
And she still appears in my dreams that way. She said, 'It took you so long.'
I apologized to her. I told her, 'I came as fast as I could.' It was just the two of us. I didn't
know what to do. I was not a nurse. There were maggots in her wounds and a sticky yellow
liquid. I tried to clean her up. But her skin was peeling off. The maggots were coming
out all over. I couldn't wipe them off, or I would wipe off her skin and muscle. I had to
pick them out. She asked me what I was doing. I told her, 'Oh, Masako. It's nothing.' She
nodded. Nine hours later, she died.
INTERVIEWER:
You were holding her in your arms all that time?
TOMOYASU:
Yes, I held her in my arms. She said, 'I don't want to die.' I told her, 'You're not going to
die.' She said, 'I promise I won't die before we get home.' But she was in pain and she kept
crying, 'Mother.'
INTERVIEWER:
It must be hard to talk about these things.
TOMOYASU:
When I heard that your organization was recording testimonies, I knew I had to come. She
died in my arms, saying, 'I don't want to die.' That is what death is like. It doesn't matter
what uniforms the soldiers are wearing. It doesn't matter how good the weapons are. I
thought if everyone could see what I saw, we would never have war anymore.
I pressed Stop on the boom box, because the interview was over. The girls were crying,
and the boys were making funny barfing noises.
'Well,' Mr. Keegan said, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief as he stood up from his
chair, 'Oskar has certainly given us a lot to think about.' I said, 'I'm not done.' He said,
'That seemed pretty complete to me.' I explained, 'Because the radiant heat traveled in
straight lines from the explosion, scientists were able to determine the direction toward the
hypocenter from a number of different points, by observing the shadows cast by intervening
objects. The shadows gave an indication of the height of the burst of the bomb, and the
diameter of the ball of fire at the instant it was exerting the maximum charring effect. Isn't
that fascinating?'
Jimmy Snyder raised his hand. I called on him. He asked, 'Why are you so weird?' I asked
if his question was rhetorical. Mr. Keegan told him to go to Principal Bundy's office. Some
of the kids cracked up. I knew they were cracking up in the bad way, which is at me, but I
tried to maintain my confidence.
'Another interesting feature that has to do with the explosion was the relationship between
100
the degree of burning and color, because dark colors absorb light, obviously. For example,
a famous chess match between two grand masters was going on that morning on a lifesize
board in one of the big city parks. The bomb destroyed everything: the spectators in
the seats, the people who were filming the match, their black cameras, the timing clocks,
even the grand masters. All that was left were white pieces on white square islands.'
As he walked out of the room, Jimmy said, 'Hey, Oskar, who's Buckminster?' I told him,
'Richard Buckminster Fuller was a scientist, philosopher, and inventor who is most famous
for designing the geodesic dome, whose most famous version is the Buckyball. He
died in 1983, I think.' Jimmy said, 'I mean your Buckminster.'
I didn't know why he was asking, because I'd brought Buckminster to school for a demonstration
only a couple of weeks before, and dropped him from the roof to show how cats
reach terminal velocity by making themselves into little parachutes, and that cats actually
have a better chance of surviving a fall from the twentieth floor than the eighth floor, because
it takes them about eight floors to realize what's going on, and relax and correct
themselves. I said, 'Buckminster is my pussy.'
Jimmy pointed at me and said, 'Ha ha!' The kids cracked up in the bad way. I didn't get
what was so hilarious. Mr. Keegan got angry and said, 'Jimmy!' Jimmy said, 'What? What
did I do?' I could tell that inside, Mr. Keegan was cracking up, too.
'What I was saving was, they found a piece of paper, about half a kilometer from the
hypocenter, and the letters, which they call characters, were neatly burned out. I became
extremely curious about what that would look like, so first I tried to cut out letters on my
own, but my hands weren't good enough to do it, so I did some research, and I found a
printer on Spring Street who specializes in die-cutting, and he said he could do it for two
hundred fifty dollars. I asked him if that included tax. He said no, but I still thought it was
worth the money, so I took my mom's credit card, and anyway, here it is.' I held up the
sheet of paper, with the first page of A Brief History of Time in Japanese, which I got the
translation of from Amazon.co.jp. I looked at the class through the story of the turtles.
That was Wednesday.
I spent Thursday's recess in the library, reading the new issue of American Drummer, which
Librarian Higgins orders especially for me. It was boring. I went to the science lab, to see if
Mr. Powers would do some experiments with me. He said he actually had plans to eat
lunch with some other teachers, and he couldn't let me be in the lab alone. So I made some
jewelry in the art studio, which you are allowed to be in alone.
Friday, Jimmy Snyder called me from across the playground, and then he came up to me
with a bunch of his friends. He said, 'Hey, Oskar, would you rather have a handjob or a
blowjob from Emma Watson?' I told him I didn't know who Emma Watson was. Matt Colber
said, 'Hermione, retard.' I said, 'Who's Hermione? And I'm not mentally retarded.'
Dave Mallon said, 'In Harry Potter, fag boy.' Steve Wicker said, 'She has sweet tits now.'
Jake Riley said, 'Handjob or blowjob?' I said, 'I've never even met her.'
I know a lot about birds and bees, but I don't know very much about the birds and the
bees. Everything I do know I had to teach myself on the Internet, because I don't have
anyone to ask. For example, I know that you give someone a blowjob by putting your penis
in their mouth. I also know that dick is penis, and that cock is penis, too. And monster
101
cock, obviously. I know that VJs get wet when a woman is having sex, although I don't
know what they get wet with. I know that VJ is cunt, and also ass. I know what dildos are,
I think, but I don't know what cum is, exactly. I know that anal sex is humping in the anus,
but I wish I didn't.
Jimmy Snyder pushed my shoulder and said, 'Say your mom's a whore.' I said, 'Your
mom's a whore.' He said, 'Say your mom's a whore.' I said, 'Your mom's a whore.'
'Say 'My' 'mom' 'is a whore.'
'Your mom is a whore.' Matt and Dave and Steve and Jake were cracking up, but Jimmy
was getting really, really angry. He raised a fist and said, 'Prepare to die.' I looked around
for a teacher, but I didn't see any. 'My mom's a whore,' I said. I went inside and read a few
more sentences of A Brief History of Time. Then I broke a mechanical pencil. When I came
home, Stan said, 'You've got mail!'
Dear Oskar,
Thanks for mailing me the $76.50 you owed me. To tell you the truth, I never
thought I'd see that money. Now I will believe everyone.
(cab driver) Many Mahaltra
P.S. No tip?
I counted off seven minutes that night, and then fourteen minutes, and then thirty. I knew
I'd never be able to fall asleep, because I was so excited that the next day I'd be able to
search for the lock. I started inventing like a beaver. I thought about how in one hundred
years every name in the 2003 Yellow Pages will be for someone who's dead, and how once
when I was at The Minch's I saw a TV show where someone ripped a phone book in half
with his hands. I thought about how I wouldn't want someone to rip a 2003 Yellow Pages
in half in one hundred years, because even though everyone will be dead, it still felt like it
should make a difference. So I invented a Black Box Yellow Pages, which is a phone book
that's made out of the material that they make the black boxes on airplanes out of. I still
couldn't sleep.
I invented a postage stamp where the back tastes like creme brulee.
I still couldn't sleep.
What if you trained Seeing Eye dogs to be bomb-sniffing dogs, so that they'd be Sniffing
Eye Seeing Bomb dogs? That way, blind people could get paid for being led around, and
could be contributing members of our society, and we'd all be safer, too. I was getting further
and further from sleep.
When I woke up it was Saturday.
I went upstairs to pick up Mr. Black, and he was waiting in front of his door, snapping his
fingers next to his ear. 'What's this?' he asked when I handed him the present I made for
him. I shrugged my shoulders, just like Dad used to. 'What am I supposed to do with it?' I
told him, 'Open it, obviously.' But I couldn't keep my happiness in, and before he got the
paper off the box I said, 'It's a necklace I made for you with a compass pendant so you can
know where you are in relation to the bed!' He kept opening it and said, 'How nice of you!'
'Yeah,' I said, taking the box from him because I could open it faster. 'It probably won't
102
work outside your apartment, because the magnetic field of the bed gets smaller the farther
you get from it, but still.' I handed him the necklace and he put it on. It said that the
bed was north.
'So where to?' he asked. 'The Bronx,' I said. 'The IRT?'
'The what?'
'The IRT train.'
'There isn't an IRT train, and I don't take public transportation.'
'Why not?'
'It's an obvious target.'
'So how do you plan on us getting there?'
'We'll walk.'
'That's got to be about twenty miles from here,' he said. 'And have you seen me walk?'
'That's true.'
'Let's take the IRT.'
'There is no IRT.'
'Whatever there is, let's take it.'
On our way out, I said, 'Stan, this is Mr. Black. Mr. Black, this is Stan.' Mr. Black stuck out
his hand, and Stan shook it. I told Stan, 'Mr. Black lives in 6A.' Stan took his hand back, but
I don't think Mr. Black was offended.
Almost the whole ride to the Bronx was underground, which made me incredibly panicky,
but once we got to the poor parts, it went above-ground, which I preferred. A lot of the
buildings in the Bronx were empty, which I could tell because they didn't have windows,
and you could see right through them, even at high speeds. We got off the train and went
down to the street. Mr. Black had me hold his hand as we looked for the address. I asked
him if he was racist. He said poverty made him nervous, not people. Just as a joke I asked
him if he was gay. He said, 'I suppose so.'
'Really?' I asked, but I didn't take back my hand, because I'm not homophobic.
The building's buzzer was broken, so the door was held open with a brick. Agnes Black's
apartment was on the third floor, and there was no elevator. Mr. Black said he'd wait for
me, because the stairs at the subway were enough stairs for him for one day. So I went up
alone. The floor of the hallway was sticky, and for some reason all of the peepholes had
black paint over them. Someone was singing from behind one of the doors, and I heard
TVs behind a bunch of others. I tried my key in Agnes's lock, but it didn't work, so I
knocked.
A little woman answered who was in a wheelchair. She was Mexican, I think. Or Brazilian,
or something. 'Excuse me, is your name Agnes Black?' She said, 'No espeaka Inglesh.'
'What?'
'No espeaka Inglesh.'
'I'm sorry,' I said, 'but I don't understand you. Could you please repeat yourself and enun-
103
ciate a little bit better.'
'No espeaka Inglesh,' she said. I pointed a finger in the air, which is the universal sign for
hold on, and then I called down to Mr. Black from the stairwell, 'I don't think she speaks
English!'
'Well, what does she speak?'
'What do you speak?' I asked her, and then I realized how dumb my question was, so I
tried a different approach: 'Parlez-vous Français?'
'Espanol,' she said. 'Espanol,' I hollered down. 'Terrific!' he hollered back. 'I picked up a little
Espanol along the way!' So I brought her wheelchair to the stairwell, and they hollered
to each other, which was kind of weird, because their voices were traveling back and forth
but they couldn't see each other's faces. They cracked up together, and their laughter ran
up and down the stairs. Then Mr. Black hollered, 'Oskar!' And I hollered, 'That's my name,
don't wear it out!' And he hollered, 'Come on down!'
When I got back to the lobby, Mr. Black explained that the person we were looking for had
been a waitress at Windows on the World. 'What the?'
'The woman I just spoke with, Feliz, didn't know her personally. She was told about her
when she moved in.'
'Really?'
'I wouldn't make that up.' We went out to the street and started walking. A car drove by
that was playing music extremely loudly, and it vibrated my heart. I looked up, and there
were strings connecting a lot of the windows with clothes hanging on them. I asked Mr.
Black if that's what people meant when they said 'clotheslines.' He said, 'That's what they
mean.' I said, 'That's what I thought.' We walked some more. Kids were kicking rocks in
the street and cracking up in the good way. Mr. Black picked up one of the rocks and put it
in his pocket. He looked at the street sign, and then at his watch. A couple of old men were
sitting in chairs in front of a store. They were smoking cigars and watching the world like
it was TV.
'That's so weird to think about,' I said. 'What is?'
'That she worked there. Maybe she knew my dad. Or not knew him, but maybe she served
him that morning. He was there, in the restaurant. He had a meeting. Maybe she refilled
his coffee or something.'
'It's possible.'
'Maybe they died together.' I know he didn't know what to say to that, because of course
they died together. The real question was how they died together, like whether they were
on different ends of the restaurant, or next to each other, or something else. Maybe they
had gone up to the roof together. You saw in some of the pictures that people jumped together
and held hands. So maybe they did that. Or maybe they just talked to each other
until the building fell. What would they have talked about? They were obviously so different.
Maybe he told her about me. I wonder what he told her. I couldn't tell how it made
me feel to think of him holding someone's hand.
'Did she have any kids?' I asked. 'I don't know.'
104
'Ask her.'
'Ask who?'
'Let's go back and ask the woman who's living there now. I bet she knows if Agnes had
any kids.' He didn't ask me why that question was important, or tell me she already told
us everything she knew. We walked back three blocks, and I went up the stairs and
brought her wheelchair back to the stairwell, and they talked up and down the stairs for a
while. Then Mr. Black hollered, 'She didn't!' But I wondered if he was lying to me, because
even though I don't speak Spanish, I could hear that she said a lot more than just no.
As we were walking back to the subway, I had a revelation, and then I got angry. 'Wait a
minute,' I said. 'What were you cracking up about before?'
'Before?'
'When you were talking to that woman the first time, you were cracking up. Both of you.'
'I don't know,' he said. 'You don't know?'
'I don't remember.'
'Try to remember.' He thought for a minute. 'I can't remember.' Lie #77.
We bought some tamales that a woman was selling by the subway from a huge pot in a
grocery cart. Normally I don't like food that isn't individually wrapped or prepared by
Mom, but we sat on the curb and ate our tamales. Mr. Black said, 'If anything, I'm invigorated.'

'What's 'invigorated'?'
'Energized. Refreshed.'
'I'm invigorated, too.' He put his arm around me and said, 'Good.'
'These are vegan, right?' I shook my tambourine as we walked up the stairs to the subway,
and held my breath when the train went underground.
Albert Black came from Montana. He wanted to be an actor, but he didn't want to go to
California, because it was too close to home, and the whole point of being an actor was to
be someone else.
Alice Black was incredibly nervous, because she lived in a building that was supposed to
be for industrial purposes, so people weren't supposed to live there. Before she opened the
door, she made us promise that we weren't from the Housing Authority. I said, 'I suggest
you take a look at us through the peephole.' She did, and then she said, 'Oh, you,' which I
thought was weird, and she let us in. Her hands were covered with charcoal, and I saw
drawings everywhere, and they were all of the same man. 'Are you forty?'
'I'm twenty-one.'
'I'm nine.'
'I'm one hundred and three.' I asked her if she was the one who made the drawings. 'Yes.'
'All of them?'
'Yes.' I didn't ask who the man in the drawings was, because I was afraid the answer
would give me heavy boots. You wouldn't draw someone that much unless you loved him
and missed him. I told her, 'You're extremely beautiful.'

'Thanks.'
'Can we kiss?' Mr. Black stuck his elbow in my side and asked her, 'Do you know anything
about this key?'
Dear Oskar Schell,
I am responding on behalf of Dr. Kaley, who is currently in the Congo on a research
expedition. She asked that I pass on her appreciation for your enthusiasm about her
work with elephants. Given that I am already her assistant – and budget limitations
being what they are, as I'm sure you've experienced – she isn't now able to take on
anyone else. But she did want me to tell you that should your interest and availability
remain, there might be a project next fall in Sudan that she will need help with.
(The grant proposals are just now going through.)
Please forward us your resume, including previous research experience, graduate
and postgraduate transcripts, and two letters of recommendation.
Best,
Gary Franklin
Allen Black lived on the Lower East Side and was a doorman for a building on Central
Park South, which was where we found him. He said he hated being a doorman, because
he had been an engineer in Russia, and now his brain was dying. He showed us a little
portable TV that he kept in his pocket. 'It plays DVDs,' he said, 'and if I had an e-mail account,
I could check it on this, too.' I told him I could set up an e-mail account for him if he
wanted. He said, 'Yeah?' I took his device, which I wasn't familiar with, but figured out
pretty quickly, and set everything up. I said, 'What do you want for a user name?' I suggested
'Allen,' or 'AllenBlack,' or a nickname. 'Or 'Engineer.' That could be cool.' He put his
finger on his mustache and thought about it. I asked if he had any kids. He said, 'A son.
Soon he's going to be taller than me. Taller and smarter. He'll be a great doctor. A brain
surgeon. Or lawyer for the Supreme Court.'
'Well, you could make it your son's name, although I guess that might be confusing.' He
said, 'Doorman.'
'What?'
'Make it 'Doorman.'
'You can make it anything you want.'
'Doorman.' I made it 'Doorman215,' because there were already 214 doormen. As we were
leaving, he said, 'Good luck, Oskar.' I said, 'How did you know my name was Oskar?' Mr.
Black said, 'You told him.' When I got home that afternoon I sent him an e-mail: 'It's too
bad you didn't know anything about the key, but it was still nice to meet you.'
Dear Oskar,
While you certainly express yourself like an intelligent young man, 'without ever
having met you, and knowing nothing of your experience with scientific research,
I'd have a hard time writing a recommendation.
Thanks for the kind words about my work, and best of luck with your explorations,
scientific and otherwise.

Most sincerely,

Arnold Black got right to the point: 'I just can't help. Sorry.' I said, 'But we haven't even
told you what we need help with.' He started getting teary and he said, 'I'm sorry,' and
closed the door. Mr. Black said, 'Onward ho.' I nodded, and inside I thought, Weird
.
Thank you for your letter. Because of the large volume of mail I receive, I am unable
to write personal responses. Nevertheless, know that I read and save every letter,
with the hope of one day being able to give each the proper response it deserves.
Until that day,
Most sincerely,

The week was incredibly boring, except for when I remembered the key. Even though I
knew that there were 161,999,999 locks in New York that it didn't open, I still felt like it
opened everything. Sometimes I liked to touch it just to know that it was there, like the
pepper spray I kept in my pocket. Or the opposite of that. I adjusted the string so the keys
– one to the apartment, one to I-didn't-know-what – rested against my heart, which was
nice, except the only thing was that it felt too cold sometimes, so I put a Band-Aid on that
part of my chest, and the keys rested on that.
Monday was boring.
On Tuesday afternoon I had to go to Dr. Fein. I didn't understand why I needed help, because
it seemed to me that you should wear heavy boots when your dad dies, and if you
aren't wearing heavy boots, then
 you need help. But I went anyway, because the raise in my allowance depended on it.
'Hey, buddy.'
'Actually, I'm not your buddy.'
'Right. Well. It's great weather today, don't you think? If you want, we could go outside
and toss a ball.'
'Yes to thinking it's great weather. No to wanting to toss a ball.'
'You sure?'
'Sports aren't fascinating.'
'What do you find fascinating?'
'What kind of answer are you looking for?'
'What makes you think I'm looking for something?'
'What makes you think I'm a huge moron?'
'I don't think you're a huge moron. I don't think you're any kind of moron.'
'Thanks.'
'Why do you think you're here, Oskar?'
'I'm here, Dr. Fein, because it upsets my mom that I'm having an impossible time with my
107
life.'
'Should it upset her?'
'Not really. Life is impossible.'
'When you say that you're having an impossible time, what do you mean?'
'I'm constantly emotional.'
'Are you emotional right now?'
'I'm extremely emotional right now.'
'What emotions are you feeling?'
'All of them.'
'LikeÃ¢Â€Â¦'
'Right now I'm feeling sadness, happiness, anger, love, guilt, joy, shame, and a little bit of
humor, because part of my brain is remembering something hilarious that Toothpaste
once did that I can't talk about.'
'Sounds like you're feeling an awful lot.'
'He put Ex-Lax in the pain au chocolat
 we sold at the French Club bake sale.'
'That is
 funny.'
'I'm feeling everything.'
'This emotionalness of yours, does it affect your daily life?'
'Well, to answer your question, I don't think that's a real word you used. Emotionalness.
But I understand what you were trying to say, and yes. I end up crying a lot, usually in
private. It's extremely hard for me to go to school. I also can't sleep over at friends' apartments,
because I get panicky about being away from Mom. I'm not very good with people.'

'What do you think is going on?'
'I feel too much. That's what's going on.'
'Do you think one can feel too much? Or just feel in the wrong ways?'
'My insides don't match up with my outsides.'
'Do anyone's insides and outsides match up?'
'I don't know. I'm only me.'
'Maybe that's what a person's personality is: the difference between the inside and outside.'

'But it's worse for me.'
'I wonder if everyone thinks it's worse for him.'
'Probably. But it really is worse for me.'
He sat back in his chair and put his pen on his desk. 'Can I ask you a personal question?'
108
'It's a free country.'
'Have you noticed any tiny hairs on your scrotum?'
'Scrotum.'
'The scrotum is the pouch at the base of your penis that holds your testicles.'
'My nuts.'
'That's right.'
'Fascinating.'
'Go ahead and take a second to think about it. I can turn around.'
'I don't need to think. I don't have tiny hairs on my scrotum.' He wrote something on a
piece of paper. 'Dr. Fein?'
'Howard.'
'You told me to tell you when I feel self-conscious.'
'Yes.'
'I feel self-conscious.'
'I'm sorry. I know it was a very personal question. I only asked because sometimes, when
our bodies change, we experience dramatic changes in our emotional lives. I was wondering
if perhaps some of what you've been experiencing is due to changes in your body.'
'It isn't. It's because my dad died the most horrible death that anyone ever could invent.
He looked at me and I looked at him. I promised myself that I wouldn't be the first to look
away. But, as usual, I was.
'What would you say to a little game?Allen'
'Is it a brain teaser?'
'Not really.'
'I like brain teasers.'
'So do I. But this isn't a brain teaser.'
'Bummer.'
'I'm going to say a word and I want you to tell me the first thing that comes to mind. You
can say a word, a person's name, or even a sound. Whatever. There are no right or wrong
answers here. No rules. Should we give it a try?' I said, 'Shoot.' He said, 'Family.' I said,
'Family.' He said, 'I'm sorry. I don't think I explained this well. I'll say a word, and you tell
me the first thing you think of.' I said, 'You said 'family' and I thought of family.' He said,
'But let's try not to use the same word. OK?'
'OK. I mean, yeah.'
'Family.'
'Heavy petting.'
'Heavy petting?'
'It's when a man rubs a woman's VJ with his fingers. Right?'
'Yes, that's right. OK. There are no wrong answers. How about safety?'
109
'How about it?'
'OK.'
'Yeah.'
'Bellybutton.'
'Bellybutton?'
'Bellybutton.'
'I can't think of anything but bellybutton.'
'Give it a try. Bellybutton.'
'Bellybutton doesn't make me think of anything.'
'Dig deep.'
'In my bellybutton?'
'In your brain, Oskar.'
'Uh.'
'Bellybutton. Bellybutton.'
'Stomach anus?'
'Good.'
'Bad.'
'No, I meant, 'Good. You did good.'
'I did well
.'
'Well.'
'Water.'
'Celebrate.'
'Ruff, ruff.'
'Was that a bark?'
'Anyway.'
'OK. Great.'
'Yeah.'
'Dirty.'
'Bellybutton.'
'Uncomfortable.'
'Extremely.'
'Yellow.'
'The color of a yellow person's bellybutton.'
'Let's see if we can keep it to one word, though, OK?'
'For a game with no rules, this game has a lot of rules.'
110
'Hurt.'
'Realistic.'
'Cucumber.'
'Formica.'
'Formica?'
'Cucumber?'
'Home.'
'Where the stuff is.'
'Emergency.'
'Dad.'
'Is your father the cause of the emergency, or the solution to it?'
'Both.'
'Happiness.'
'Happiness. Oops. Sorry.'
'Happiness.'
'I don't know.'
'Try. Happiness.'
'Dunno.'
'Happiness. Dig.' I shrugged my shoulders. 'Happiness, happiness.'
'Dr. Fein?'
'Howard.'
'Howard?'
'Yes?'
'I'm feeling self-conscious.'
We spent the rest of the forty-five minutes talking, although I didn't have anything to say
to him. I didn't want to be there. I didn't want to be anywhere that wasn't looking for the
lock. When it was almost time for Mom to come in, Dr. Fein said he wanted us to make a
plan for how the next week could be better than the last one. He said,
'Why don't you tell me some things you think you can do, things to keep in mind. And
then next week we'll talk about how successful you were.'
'I'll try to go to school.'
'Good. Really good. What else?'
'Maybe I'll try to be more patient with morons.'
'Good. And what else?'
'I don't know, maybe I'll try not to ruin things by getting so emotional.'
'Anything else?'
'I'll try to be nicer to my mom.'
111
'And?'
'Isn't that enough?'
'It is. It's more than enough. And now let me ask you, how do you think you're going to
accomplish those things you mentioned?'
'I'm gonna bury my feelings deep inside me.'
'What do you mean, bury your feelings?'
'No matter how much I feel, I'm not going to let it out. If I have to cry, I'm gonna cry on the
inside. If I have to bleed, I'll bruise. If my heart starts going crazy, I'm not gonna tell everyone
in the world about it. It doesn't help anything. It just makes everyone's life worse.'
'But if you're burying your feelings deep inside you, you won't really be you, will you?'
'So?'
'Can I ask you one last question?'
'Was that it?'
'Do you think any good can come from your father's death?'
'Do I think any good
 can come from my father's death?'
'Yes. Do you think any
 good can come from your father's death?' I kicked over my chair, threw his papers across
the floor, and hollered, 'No! Of course not, you fucking asshole!'
That was what I wanted to do. Instead I just shrugged my shoulders.
I went out to tell Mom it was her turn. She asked me how it went. I said, 'OK.' She said,
'Your magazines are in my bag. And a juice box.' I said, 'Thanks.' She bent down and
kissed me.
When she went in, I very quietly took the stethoscope from my field kit, got on my knees,
and pressed the whatever-the-end-is-called against the door. The bulb? Dad would have
known. I couldn't hear a lot, and sometimes I wasn't sure if no one was talking or if I just
wasn't hearing what they were saying.

We were quiet on the car ride home. I turned on the radio and found a station playing
'Hey Jude.' It was true, I didn't want to make it bad. I wanted to take the sad song and
make it better. It's just that I didn't know how.
After dinner, I went up to my room. I took the box out of the closet, and the box out of the
box, and the bag, and the unfinished scarf, and the phone.

WHY I'M NOT WHERE YOU ARE
 4/12/78
To my child: I'm writing this from where your mother's father's shed used to stand, the
shed is no longer here, no carpets cover no floors, no windows in no walls, everything has
been replaced. This is a library now, that would have made your grandfather happy, as if
all of his buried books were seeds, from each book came one hundred. I'm sitting at the
end of a long table surrounded by encyclopedias, sometimes I take one down and read
about other people's lives, kings, actresses, assassins, judges, anthropologists, tennis
champions, tycoons, politicians, just because you haven't received any letters from me
don't think I haven't written any. Every day I write a letter to you. Sometimes I think if I
could tell you what happened to me that night, I could leave that night behind me, maybe
I could come home to you, but that night has no beginning or end, it started before I was
born and it's still happening. I'm writing in Dresden, and
your mother is writing in the Nothing guest room, or I assume she is, I hope she is, sometimes
my hand starts to burn and I am convinced we are writing the same word at the
same moment. Anna gave me the typewriter your mother used to write her life story on.
She gave it to me only a few weeks before the bombings, I thanked her, she said, 'Why are
you thanking me? It's a gift for me.'
'A gift for you?'
'You never write to me.'
'But I'm with you.'
114
'So?'
'You write to someone you can't be with.'
'You never sculpt me, but at least you could write to me.' It's the tragedy of loving, you
can't love anything more than something you miss. I told her, 'You never write to me.' She
said, 'You've never given me a typewriter.' I started to invent future homes for us, I'd type
through the night and give them to her the next day. I imagined dozens of homes, some
were magical (a clock tower with a stopped clock in a city where time stood still), some
were mundane (a bourgois estate in the country with rose gardens and peacocks), each felt
possible and perfec
t, wonder if your mother ever saw them. 'Dear Anna, We will live in a home built at the
top of the world's tallest ladder.'
'Dear Anna, We will live in a cave in a hillside in Turkey.'
'Dear Anna, We will live in a home with no walls, so that everywhere we go will be our
home.' I wasn't trying to invent better and better homes, but to show her that homes didn't
matter, we could live in any home, in any city, in any country, in any century, and be
happy, as if the world were just what we lived in. The night before I lost everything, I
typed our last future home: 'Dear Anna, We will live in a series of homes, which will climb
the Alps and we'll never sleep in the same one twice. Each morning after breakfast, we'll
sled down to the next home. And when we open its front door, the previous home will be
destroyed and rebuilt as a new home. When we get to the bottom, we'll take a lift to the
top and start again at the beginning.' I went to bring it to her the next day, on my way to
your mothers house, I heard a noise from the shed, from where I'm now writing this to
you, I suspected it was Simon Goldberg. I knew that Anna's father had been hiding him, I
had heard them talking in there some nights when Anna and I tiptoed into the fields, they
were always whispering, I had seen his charcoal stained shirt on their clothesline. I didn't
want to make myself known, so I quietly slid a book from the wall. Anna's father, your
grandfather, was sitting in his chair with his face in his hands, he was my hero. When I
think back on that moment, I never see him with his face in his hands, I won't let myself
see him that way, I see the book in my hands, it was an illustrated edition of Qvid's Metamorphosis,
used to look for the edition in the States, as if by finding it I could slide it back
in the shed's wall, block the image of my hero's face in his hands, stop my life and history
at that moment, I asked after it in every bookshop in New York, but I never was able to
find flight poured into the room through the hole in the wall, your grandfather lifted his
head, he came to the shelf and we looked at each other through the missing Metamorphosis,
I asked him if something was wrong, he didn't say anything, I could see only a sliver
of his face, the spine of a book of his face, looked at each other until it felt like everything
would burst into flames,
it was the silence of my life. I found Anna in her room, 'Hi.'
'Hi.'
'I just saw your father?'
'In the shed?'
'He seems upset.'
115
'He doesn't want to be part of it anymore.' I told her, 'It will all be over soon.'
'How do you know?'
'Everyone says so.'
'Everyone has always been wrong.'
'It will be over, and life will go back to how it was.' She said, 'Don't be a child.'
'Don't turn away from me.' She wouldn't look at me. I asked, 'What's happened?' I'd never
seen her cry before. I told her, 'Don't cry.' She said, 'Don't touch me.' I asked, 'What is it?'
She said, 'Will you please shut up!' We sat on her bed in silence. The silence pressed down
on us like a hand. I said, 'Whatever it is – ' She said 'I'm pregnant.' I can't write what we
said to each other then. Before I left, she said, 'Please be overjoyed.' I told her I was, of
course I was, I kissed her, I kissed her stomach, that was the last time I ever saw her. At
9:30 that night, the air-raid sirens sounded, everyone went to the shelters, but no one hurried,
we were use to the alarms, we assumed they were false, why would anyone want to
bomb Dresden? The families on our street turned off the lights in their houses and filed
into the shelter, waited on the steps, I was thinking of Anna. It was silent and still and I
couldn't see my own hands in the darkness. One hundred planes flew overhead, massive,
heavy planes, pushing through the night like one hundred whales through water, they
dropped clusters of red flares to light up the blackness for whatever was to come next, I
was alone on the street, the red flares fell around me, thousands of them, knew that something
unimaginable was about to happen, was thinking of Anna, I was overjoyed. I ran
downstairs four steps at a time, they saw the look on my face, before I had time to say anything
– what would I have said? – we heard a horrible noise, rapid, approaching explosions,
like an applauding audience running toward us, then they were atop us, we were
thrown to the corners, our cellar filled with fire and smoke, more powerful explosions, the
walls lifted from the floor and separated just long enough to let light flood in before banging
back to the ground, orange and blue explosions, violet and white, I later read that the
first bombing lasted less than half an hour, but it felt like days and weeks, like the world
was going to end, the bombing stopped as matter of factly as it had
began, ' Are you OK?'
'Are you OK?'
'Are you OK?' We ran out of the cellar, which was flooded with yellow-gray smoke, we
didn't recognize anything, I had been on the stoop just half an hour before, and now there
was no stoop in front of no house on no street, only fire in every direction, all that remained
of our house was a patch of the facade that stubbornly held up the front door, a
horse on fire galloped past, there were burning vehicles and carts with burning refugies,
people were screaming, I told my parents I had to go find Anna, my mother told me to
stay with them, I said I would meet them back at our front door, my father begged me to
stay, I grabbed the doorknob and it took the skin off my hand, I saw the muscles of my
palm, red and pulsing, why did I grab it with my other hand? My father shouted at me, it
was the first time he had ever shouted at me, I can't write what he shouted, I told them I
would meet them back at our door, he struck me across the face, it was the first time he
had ever struck me, that was the last time I saw my parents. On my way to Anna's house,
the second raid began, threw myself into the nearest cellar, it was hit, it filled with pink
116
smoke and gold flames, so I fled into the next cellar, caught fire, I ran from cellar to cellar
as each previous cellar was destroyed, burning monkeys screamed from the trees, birds
with their wings on fire sang from the telephone wires over which desperate calls traveled,
found another shelter, it was filled to the walls, brown smoke pressed down from the
ceiling like a hand, became more and more difficult to breathe, my lungs were trying to
pull the room in through my mouth, there was a silver explosion, all of us tried to leave
the cellar at once, dead and dying people were trampled, I walked over an old man, I
walked over children, everyone was losing everyone, the bombs were like a waterfall, I
ran through the streets, from cellar to cellar, and saw terrible things: legs and necks, I saw
a woman whose blond hair and green dress were on fire, running with a silent baby in her
arms, I saw humans melted into thick pools of liquid, three or four feet deep in places, I
saw bodies crackling like embers, laughing, and the remains of masses of people who had
tried to escape the firestorm by jumping head first into the lakes and ponds, the parts of
their bodies that were submerged in the water were still intact, while the parts that protruded
above water were charred beyond recognition, the bombs kept falling, purple, orange
and white, I kept running, my hands kept bleeding, through the sounds of collapsing
buildings I heard the roar of that baby's silence. I passed the zoo, the cages had been
ripped open, everything was everywhere, dazed animals cried in pain and confusion, one
of the keepers was calling out for help, he was a strong man, his eyes had been burnt
closed, he grabbed my arm and asked me if I knew how to fire a gun, I told him I had to
get to someone, he handed me his rifle and said, 'You've got to find the carnivores,' I told
him I wasn't a good shot, I told him I didn't know which were carnivores and which
weren't, he said, 'Shoot everything,' I don't know how many animals I killed, I killed an
elephant, it had been thrown twenty yards from its cage, I pressed the rifle to the back of
its head and wondered, as I squeezed the trigger, Is it necessary to kill this animal? I killed
an ape that was perched on the stump of a fallen tree, pulling its hair as it surveyed the
destruction, I killed two lions, they were standing side by side facing west, were they related,
were they friends, mates, can lions love? I killed a cub that was climbing atop a massive
dead bear, as it climbing atop its parent? I killed a camel with twelve bullets, I suspected
it wasn't a carnivore, but I was killing everything, everything had to be killed, a
rhinoceros was banging its head against a rock, again and again, as if to put itself out of its
suffering, or to make itself suffer, I fired at it, it kept banging its head, I fired again, it
banged harder, I walked up to it and pressed the gun between its eyes, I killed it, I killed a
zebra, I killed a giraffe, I turned the water of the sea lion's tank red, an ape approached me,
it was the ape I had shot before, I'd thought I'd killed it, it walked up to me slowly, its
hands covering its ears, what did it want from me, I screamed, 'What do you want from
me?' I shot it again, where I thought its heart was, it looked at me, in its eyes I was sure I
saw some form of understandings, but I didn't see forgiveness, I tried to shoot the vultures,
but I wasn't a good enough shot, later I saw vultures fattening themselves on the
human carnage, and I blamed myself for everything. The second bombing halted as suddenly
and totally as it had began, with burnt hair, with black arms and black fingers, I
walked, dazed, to the base of the Loschwitz Bridge, I submerged my black hands in the
black water and saw my reflection, I was terrified of my own image, my blood-matted
hair, my split and bleeding lips, my red, pulsing palms, which, even as I write this, thirty-
117
five years later, don't look like they should be at the ends of my arms. I remember losing
my balance, I remember a single thought in my head: Keep thinking. As long as I am thinking,
I am alive, but at some point I stopped thinking,, the next thing I remember is feeling
terribly cold, I realized I was lying on the ground, the pain was complete, it let me know I
hadn't died, started moving my legs and arms, my movements must have been noticed by
one of the soldiers that had been put into action all over the city, looking for survivors, I
later learned that there had been more than 220 bodies taken from the foot of the bridge,
and 4 came back to life, I was one of them. They loaded us onto trucks and took us out of
Dresden, I looked out from the flaps of canvas that covered the sides of the truck, the
buildings were burning, the trees burning, the asphalt, I saw and heard humans trapped, I
smelled them, standing in the moltin, burning streets like living torches, screaming for
help that was impossible to give, the air itself was burning, the truck had to make a number
of detours to get beyond the chaos, planes bore down on us once more, we were
pulled off the truck and placed under it, the planes dove, more machine guns, more
bombs, yellow, red, green, blue, brown, I lost consciousness again, when I awoke I was in
a white hospital bed, I couldn't move my arms or legs, I wondered if I had lost them, but I
couldn't summon the energy to look for myself, hours passed, or days, when I finally
looked down, I saw that I was strapped to the bed, a nurse was standing beside me, I
asked, 'Why have you done this to me?' She told me I had been trying to hurt myself, I
asked her to free me, she said she couldn't, she said I would hurt myself, I begged her to
free me, I told her I wouldn't hurt myself, I promised, she apologized and touched me,
doctors operated on me, they gave me injections and bandaged my body, but it was her
touching that saved my life. In the days and weeks after my release, I looked for my parents
and for Anna and for you. Everyone was looking for everyone in the rubble of every
building, but all of the searching was in vain, I found our old house, the door was still
stubbornly standing, a few of our belongings survived, the typewriter survived, I carried it
in my arms like a baby,, before I was evacuated I wrote on the door that I was alive, and
the address of the refugee camp in Oschatz, I waited for a letter, but no letter ever came.
Because there were so many bodies, and because so many of the bodies had been destroyed
there was never a list of the dead, thousands of people were left to suffer hope.
When I had thought I was dying at the base of the Loschwitz Bridge, there was a single
thought in my head: Keep thinking. Thinking would keep me alive. But now I am alive, and
thinking is killing me. I think and think and think. I can't stop thinking about that night,
the clusters of red flares, the sky that was like black water, and how only hours before I
lost everything, I had everything. Your aunt had told me she was pregnant, I was overjoyed,
I should have known not to trust it, one hundred years joy can be erased in one second,
I kissed her belly, even though there was nothing yet to kiss, told her, 'I love our
baby.' That made her laugh, I hadn't heard her laugh like that since the day we walked
into each other halfway between our houses, she said,
'You love an idea.' I told her, 'I love our idea.' That was the point, we were having an idea
together. She asked, 'Are you afraid?'
'Afraid of what?' She said, 'Life is scarier than death.' I took the future home from my
pocket and gave it to her, I kissed her, I kissed her stomach, that was the last time I ever
saw her. I was at the end of the path when I heard her father. He came out of the shed. 'I
118
almost forgot!' he called to me. 'There's a letter here for you. It was delivered yesterday. I
almost forgot.' He ran into the house and came back out with an envelope. 'I almost forgot,'
he said, his eyes were red, his knuckles were white, I later learned that he survived
the bombing and then killed himself. Did your mother tell you that? Does she know it herself?
He handed a letter to me. it was from Simon Goldberg. The letter had been posted
from Westerbork transit camp in Holland, that's where the Jews from our region were
sent, from there they went either to work or to their deaths. 'Dear Thomas Schell, It was a
pleasure meeting you, however briefly. For reasons that need not be explained, you made
a strong impression on me. It is my great hope that our paths, however long and winding,
will cross again. Until that day, I wish the best for you in these difficult times. Yours most
sincerely, Simon Goldberg.' I put the letter back in the envelope and the envelope in my
pocket, where the future home had been, I heard your grandfather's voice as I walked
away, he was still at the door, 'I almost forgot' When your mother found me in the bakery
on Broadway I wanted to tell her everything, maybe if I'd been able to, we could have
lived differently, maybe I'd be there with you now instead of here. Maybe if I had said, 'I
lost a baby,' if I'd said, 'I'm so afraid of losing something I love that I refuse to love anything,'
maybe that would have made the impossible possible. Maybe, but I couldn't do it, I
had buried too much too deeply inside me. And here I am instead of there. I'm sitting in
this library, thousands of miles from my life writing another letter
I know I won't be able to send, no matter how hard I try and how much I want to. How
did that boy making love behind that shed become this man writing this letter at this table?

I love you,
Your father
THE SIXTH BOROUGH
 Once upon a time, New York City had a sixth borough.'
'What's a borough?'
'That's what I call an interruption.'
'I know, but the story won't make any sense to me if I don't know what a borough is.'
'It's like a neighborhood. Or a collection of neighborhoods.'
'So if there was once a sixth borough, then what are the five boroughs?'
'Manhattan, obviously, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx.'
'Have I ever been to any of the other boroughs?'
'Here we go.'
119
'I just want to know.'
'We went to the Bronx Zoo once, a few years ago. Remember that?'
'No.'
'And we've been to Brooklyn to see the roses at the Botanic Garden.'
'Have I been to Queens?'
'I don't think so.'
'Have I been to Staten Island?'
'No.'
'Was there really
 a sixth borough?'
'I've been trying to tell you.'
'No more interruptions. I promise.'
'Well, you won't read about it in any of the history books, because there's nothing – save
for the circumstantial evidence in Central Park – to prove that it was there at all. Which
makes its existence very easy to dismiss. But even though most people will say they have
no time for or reason to believe in the Sixth Borough, and don't
 believe in the Sixth Borough, they will still use the word 'believe.'
'The Sixth Borough was also an island, separated from Manhattan by a thin body of water
whose narrowest crossing happened to equal the world's long jump record, such that exactly
one person on earth could go from Manhattan to the Sixth Borough without getting
wet. A huge party was made of the yearly leap. Bagels were strung from island to island
on special spaghetti, samosas were bowled at baguettes, Greek salads were thrown like
confetti. The children of New York captured fireflies in glass jars, which they floated between
the boroughs. The bugs would slowly asphyxiate – '
'Asphyxiate?'
'Suffocate.'
'Why didn't they just punch holes into the lids?'
'The fireflies would flicker rapidly for their last few minutes of life. If it was timed right,
the river shimmered as the jumper crossed it.'
'Cool
.'
'When the time finally came, the long jumper would begin his approach from the East
River. He would run the entire width of Manhattan, as New Yorkers rooted him on from
opposite sides of the street, from the windows of their apartments and offices, and from
the branches of trees. Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Lexington, Park, Madison, Fifth
Avenue, Columbus, Amsterdam, Broadway, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, TenthÃ¢Â€Â¦And
when he leapt, New Yorkers cheered from the banks of both Manhattan and the Sixth Borough,
cheering the jumper on and cheering each other on. For those few moments that the
jumper was in the air, every New Yorker felt capable of flight.
120
'Or maybe 'suspension' is a better word. Because what was so inspiring about the leap was
not how the jumper got from one borough to the other, but how he stayed between them
for so long.'
'That's true.'
'One year – many, many years ago – the end of the jumper's big toe skimmed the surface
of the river, causing a little ripple. People gasped as the ripple traveled out from the Sixth
Borough back toward Manhattan, knocking the jars of fireflies against one another like
wind chimes.
'You must have gotten a bad start!' a Manhattan councilman hollered from across the water.

'The jumper shook his head, more confused than ashamed.
'You had the wind in your face,' a Sixth Borough councilman suggested, offering a towel
for the jumper's foot.
'The jumper shook his head.
'Perhaps he ate too much for lunch,' said one onlooker to another.
'Or maybe he's past his prime,' said another, who'd brought his kids to watch the leap.
'I bet his heart wasn't in it,' said another. 'You just can't expect to jump that far without
some serious feeling.'
'No,' the jumper said to all of the speculation. 'None of that's right. I jumped just fine.'
'The revelation – '
'Revelation?'
'Realization.'
'Oh yeah.'
'It traveled across the onlookers like the ripple caused by the toe, and when the mayor of
New York City spoke it aloud, everyone sighed in agreement: 'The Sixth Borough is moving.'

'Moving
!'
'A millimeter at a time, the Sixth Borough receded from New York. One year, the long
jumper's entire foot got wet, and after a number of years, his shin, and after many, many
years – so many years that no one could remember what it was like to celebrate without
anxiety – the jumper had to reach out his arms and grab at the Sixth Borough fully extended,
and then he couldn't touch it at all. The eight bridges between Manhattan and the
Sixth Borough strained and finally crumbled, one at a time, into the water. The tunnels
were pulled too thin to hold anything at all.
'The phone and electrical lines snapped, requiring Sixth Boroughers to revert to oldfashioned
technologies, most of which resembled children's toys: they used magnifying
glasses to reheat their carry-out; they folded important documents into paper airplanes
and threw them from one office building into another; those fireflies in glass jars, which
had once been used merely for decorative purposes during the festivals of the leap, were
121
now found in every room of every home, taking the place of artificial light.
'The very same engineers who dealt with the Leaning Tower of PisaÃ¢Â€Â¦which was
where?'
'Italy
!'
'Right. They were brought over to assess the situation.
'It wants to go,' they said.
'Well, what can you say about that?' the mayor of New York asked.
'To which they replied: 'There's nothing to say about that.'
'Of course they tried to save it. Although 'save' might not be the right word, as it did seem
to want to go. Maybe 'detain' is the right word. Chains were moored to the banks of the
islands, but the links soon snapped. Concrete pilings were poured around the perimeter of
the Sixth Borough, but they, too, failed. Harnesses failed, magnets failed, even prayer
failed.
'Young friends, whose string-and-tin-can phone extended from island to island, had to pay
out more and more string, as if letting kites go higher and higher.
'It's getting almost impossible to hear you,' said the young girl from her bedroom in Manhattan
as she squinted through a pair of her father's binoculars, trying to find her friend's
window.
'I'll holler if I have to,' said her friend from his bedroom in the Sixth Borough, aiming last
birthday's telescope at her apartment.
'The string between them grew incredibly long, so long it had to be extended with many
other strings tied together: his yo-yo string, the pull from her talking doll, the twine that
had fastened his father's diary, the waxy string that had kept her grandmother's pearls
around her neck and off the floor, the thread that had separated his great-uncle's childhood
quilt from a pile of rags. Contained within everything they shared with one another
were the yo-yo, the doll, the diary, the necklace, and the quilt. They had more and more to
tell each other, and less and less string.
'The boy asked the girl to say 'I love you' into her can, giving her no further explanation.
'And she didn't ask for any, or say 'That's silly,' or 'We're too young for love,' or even suggest
that she was saying 'I love you' because he asked her to. Instead she said, 'I love you.'
The words traveled the yo-yo, the doll, the diary, the necklace, the quilt, the clothesline,
the birthday present, the harp, the tea bag, the tennis racket, the hem of the skirt he one
day should have pulled from her body.'
'Grody
!'
'The boy covered his can with a lid, removed it from the string, and put her love for him
on a shelf in his closet. Of course, he never could open the can, because then he would lose
its contents. It was enough just to know it was there.
'Some, like that boy's family, wouldn't leave the Sixth Borough. Some said, 'Why should
122
we? It's the rest of the world that's moving. Our borough is fixed. Let them leave Manhattan.'
How can you prove someone like that wrong? And who would want to?'
'I wouldn't.'
'Neither would I. For most Sixth Boroughers, though, there was no question of refusing to
accept the obvious, just as there was no underlying stubbornness, or principle, or bravery.
They just didn't want to go.
They liked their lives and didn't want to change. So they floated away, one millimeter at a
time.
'All of which brings us to Central Park. Central Park didn't used to be where it is now.'
'You just mean in the story, right?'
'It used to rest squarely in the center of the Sixth Borough. It was the joy of the borough, its
heart. But once it was clear that the Sixth Borough was receding for good, that it couldn't
be saved or detained, it was decided, by New York City referendum, to salvage the park.'
'Referendum?'
'Vote.'
'And?'
'And it was unanimous. Even the most stubborn Sixth Boroughers acknowledged what
must be done.
'Enormous hooks were driven through the easternmost grounds, and the park was pulled
by the people of New York, like a rug across a floor, from the Sixth Borough into Manhattan.

'Children were allowed to lie down on the park as it was being moved. This was considered
a concession, although no one knew why a concession was necessary, or why it was
to children that this concession must be made. The biggest fireworks show in history lit
the skies of New York City that night, and the Philharmonic played its heart out.
'The children of New York lay on their backs, body to body, filling every inch of the park,
as if it had been designed for them and that moment. The fireworks sprinkled down, dissolving
in the air just before they reached the ground, and the children were pulled, one
millimeter and one second at a time, into Manhattan and adulthood. By the time the park
found its current resting place, every single one of the children had fallen asleep, and the
park was a mosaic of their dreams. Some hollered out, some smiled unconsciously, some
were perfectly still.'
'Dad?'
'Yes?'
'I know there wasn't really a sixth borough. I mean, objectively.'
'Are you an optimist or a pessimist?'
'I can't remember. Which?'
'Do you know what those words mean?'
'Not really.'
123
'An optimist is positive and hopeful. A pessimist is negative and cynical.'
'I'm an optimist.'
'Well, that's good, because there's no irrefutable evidence. There's nothing that could convince
someone who doesn't want to be convinced. But there is an abundance of clues that
would give the wanting believer something to hold on to.'
'Like what?'
'Like the peculiar fossil record of Central Park. Like the incongruous pH of the reservoir.
Like the placement of certain tanks at the zoo, which correspond to the holes left by the
gigantic hooks that pulled the park from borough to borough.'
'Jose.'
'There is a tree – just twenty-four paces due east of the entrance to the merry-go-round –
into whose trunk are carved two names. There is no record of them in the phone books or
censuses. They are absent from all hospital and tax and voting documentation. There is no
evidence whatsoever of their existence, other than the proclamation on the tree. Here's a
fact you might find fascinating: no less than five percent of the names carved into the trees
of Central Park are of unknown origin.'
'That is
 fascinating.'
'As all of the Sixth Borough's documents floated away with the Sixth Borough, we will
never be able to prove that those names belonged to residents of the Sixth Borough, and
were carved when Central Park still resided there, instead of in Manhattan. Some people
believe they are made-up names and, to take the doubt a step further, that the gestures of
love were made-up gestures. Others believe other things.'
'What do you believe?'
'Well, it's hard for anyone, even the most pessimistic of pessimists, to spend more than a
few minutes in Central Park without feeling that he or she is experiencing some tense in
addition to the present, right?'
'I guess
.'
'Maybe we're just missing things we've lost, or hoping for what we want to come. Or
maybe it's the residue of the dreams from that night the park was moved. Maybe we miss
what those children had lost, and hope for what they hoped for.'
'And what about the Sixth Borough?'
'What do you mean?'
'What happened to it?'
'Well, there's a gigantic hole in the middle of it where Central Park used to be. As the island
moves across the planet, it acts like a frame, displaying what lies beneath it.'
'Where is it now?'
'Antarctica.'
124
'Really?'
'The sidewalks are covered in ice, the stained glass of the public library is straining under
the weight of the snow. There are frozen fountains in frozen neighborhood parks, where
frozen children are frozen at the peaks of their swings – the frozen ropes holding them in
flight. Livery horses – '
'What's that?'
'The horses that pull the carriages in the park.'
'They're inhumane.'
'They're frozen mid-trot. Flea-market vendors are frozen mid-haggle. Middle-aged women
are frozen in the middle of their lives. The gavels of frozen judges are frozen between guilt
and innocence. On the ground are the crystals of the frozen first breaths of babies, and
those of the last gasps of the dying. On a frozen shelf, in a closet frozen shut, is a can with
a voice in it.'
'Dad?'
'Yeah?'
'This isn't an interruption, but are you done?'
'The end.'
'That story was really awesome.'
'I'm glad you think so.'
'Awesome
.'
'Dad?'
'Yeah?'
'I just thought of something. Do you think any of those things I dug up in Central Park
were actually from the Sixth Borough?'
He shrugged his shoulders, which I loved.
'Dad?'
'Yeah, buddy?'
'Nothing.'
MY FEELINGS
 I was in the guest room when it happened. I was watching the television and knitting you
a white scarf. The news was on. Time was passing like a hand waving from a train that I
125
wanted to be on. You'd only just left for school, and I was already waiting for you. I hope
you never think about anything as much as I think about you. I remember they were interviewing
the father of a missing girl. I remember his eyebrows. I remember his sadly
cleanly shaven face. Do you still believe that she will be found alive? I do.
Sometimes I was looking at the television. Sometimes I was looking at my hands knitting
your scarf. Sometimes out the window at your window. Are there any new leads in the
case? Not to my knowledge. But you continue to believe. Yes.
What would it take for you to give up? Why was it necessary to torture him? He touched
his forehead and said, It would take a body. The woman asking the questions touched her
ear. She said, I am sorry. One second. She said, Something has happened in New York.
The father of the missing girl touched his chest and looked past the camera. At his wife?
At someone he didn't know? At something he wanted to see? Maybe it sounds strange, but
I didn't feel anything when they showed the burning building. I wasn't even surprised. I
kept knitting for you, and I kept thinking about the father of the missing girl. He kept believing.

Smoke kept pouring from a hole in the building. Black smoke.
I remember the worst storm of my childhood. From my window I saw the books pulled
from my father's shelves. They flew. A tree that was older than any person tipped away
from our house. But it could have been the other way.
When the second plane hit, the woman who was giving the news started to scream.
A ball of fire rolled out of the building and up.
One million pieces of paper filled the sky. They stayed there, like a ring around the building.
Like the rings of Saturn. The rings of coffee staining my father's desk. The ring Thomas
told me he didn't need. I told him he wasn't the only one who needed. The next morning
my father had us carve our names into the stump of the tree that fell away from our
house. We were giving thanks. Your mother called. Are you watching the news? Yes.
Have you heard from Thomas? No.
I haven't heard from him either. I'm worried. Why are you worried? I told you. I haven't
heard from him. But he's at the store.
He had a meeting in that building and I haven't heard from him. I turned my head and
thought I would vomit. I dropped the phone, ran to the toilet, and vomited. I wouldn't
ruin the rug. That's who I am. I called your mother back.
She told me you were at home. She had just spoken to you. I told her I would go over and
watch you. Don't let him see the news.
OK.
If he asks anything, just let him know that it will be OK. I told her, It will be OK.
She said, The subways are a mess. I'm going to walk home. I should be there in an hour.
She said, I love you.
She had been married to your father for twelve years. I had known her for fifteen years. It
was the first time she told me she loved me. That was when I knew that she knew. I ran
across the street.
126
The doorman said you'd gone up ten minutes before. He asked if I was all right. I nodded.
What happened to your arm?
I looked at my arm. It was bleeding through my shirt. Had I fallen and not noticed? Had I
been scratching it? That was when I knew that I knew.
No one answered the door when I rang, so I used my key. I called to you. Oskar!
You were silent, but I knew you were there. I could feel you. Oskar!
I looked in the coat closet. I looked behind the sofa. A Scrabble board was on the coffee table.
Words were running into each other. I went to your room. It was empty. I looked in
your closet. You weren't there. I went to your parents' room. I knew you were somewhere.
I looked in your father's closet. I touched the tuxedo that was over his chair. I put my
hands in its pockets. He had his father's hands. Your grandfather's hands. Will you have
those hands? The pockets reminded me.
I went back to your room and lay down on your bed. I couldn't see the stars on your ceiling
because the lights were on. I thought about the walls of the house I grew up in. My
fingerprints. When the walls collapsed, my fingerprints collapsed. I heard you breathing
beneath me. Oskar?
I got on the ground. On my hands and knees.
Is there room for two under there?
No.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Would it be all right if I tried?
I guess.
I could only barely squeeze myself under the bed.
We lay there on our backs. There wasn't enough room to turn to face each other. None of
the light could reach us.
How was school?
It was OK.
You got there on time?
I was early.
So you waited outside?
Yeah.
What did you do?
I read.
What?
What what?
What did you read?
A Brief History of Time
127
.
Is it any good?
That's not really a question you can ask about it.
And your walk home?
It was OK.
It's beautiful weather.
Yeah.
I can't remember more beautiful weather than this.
That's true.
It's a shame to be inside.
I guess so.
But here we are.
I wanted to turn to face him, but I couldn't. I moved my hand to touch his hand.
They let you out of school?
Practically immediately.
Do you know what happened?
Yeah.
Have you heard from Mom or Dad?
Mom.
What did she say?
She said everything was fine and she would be home soon.
Dad will be home soon, too. Once he can close up the store.
Yeah.
You pressed your palms into the bed like you were trying to lift it off us.
I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't know what. I just knew there was something I
needed to tell you.
Do you want to show me your stamps?
No thank you.
Or we could do some thumb wars.
Maybe later.
Are you hungry?
No.
Do you want to just wait here for Mom and Dad to come home?
I guess so.
Do you want me to wait here with you?
It's OK.
128
Are you sure?
Positive.
Can I please, Oskar?
OK.
Sometimes I felt like the space was collapsing onto us. Someone was on the bed. Mary
jumping. Your father sleeping. Anna kissing me.
I felt buried. Anna holding the sides of my face. My father pinching my cheeks. Everything
on top of me.
When your mother came home, she gave you such a fierce hug. I wanted to protect you
from her.
She asked if your father had called.
No.
Are there any messages on the phone?
No.
You asked her if your father was in the building for a meeting. She told you no.
You tried to find her eyes, and that was when I knew that you knew. She called the police.
It was busy. She called again. It was busy. She kept calling. When it wasn't busy, she asked
to speak to someone. There was no one to speak to.
You went to the bathroom. I told her to control herself. At least in front of you.
She called the newspapers. They didn't know anything. She called the fire department. No
one knew anything.
All afternoon I knitted that scarf for you. It grew longer and longer. Your mother closed
the windows, but we could still smell the smoke. She asked me if I thought we should
make posters. I said it might be a good idea.
That made her cry, because she had been depending on me. The scarf grew longer and
longer.
She used the picture from your vacation. From only two weeks before. It was you and
your father. When I saw it, I told her she shouldn't use a picture that had your face in it.
She said she wasn't going to use the whole picture. Only your father's face. I told her, Still,
it isn't a good idea.
She said, There are more important things to worry about. Just use a different picture. Let
it go, Mom. She had never called me Mom. There are so many pictures to choose from.
Mind your own business. This is my business. We were not angry at each other.
I don't know how much you understood, but probably you understood everything.
She took the posters downtown that afternoon. She filled a rolling suitcase with them. I
thought of your grandfather. I wondered where he was at that moment. I didn't know if I
wanted him to be suffering.
She took a stapler. And a box of staples. And tape. I think of those things now. The paper,
the stapler, the staples, the tape. It makes me sick. Physical things. Forty years of loving
129
someone becomes staples and tape.
It was just the two of us. You and me.
We played games in the living room. You made jewelry. The scarf grew longer and longer.
We went for a walk in the park. We didn't talk about what was on top of us. What was
pinning us down like a ceiling. When you fell asleep with your head on my lap, I turned
on the television.
I lowered the volume until it was silent.
The same pictures over and over.
Planes going into buildings.
Bodies falling.
People waving shirts out of high windows.
Planes going into buildings.
Bodies falling.
Planes going into buildings.
People covered in gray dust.
Bodies falling.
Buildings falling.
Planes going into buildings.
Planes going into buildings.
Buildings falling.
People waving shirts out of high windows.
Bodies falling.
Planes going into buildings.
Sometimes I felt your eyelids nickering. Were you awake? Or dreaming?
Your mother came home late that night. The suitcase was empty.
She hugged you until you said, You're hurting me.
She called everyone your father knew, and everyone who might know something. She told
them, I'm sorry to wake you. I wanted to shout into her ear, Don't be sorry!
She kept touching her eyes, although there were no tears.
They thought there would be thousands of injured people. Unconscious people. People
without memories. They thought there would be thousands of bodies. They were going to
put them in an ice-skating rink.
Remember when we went skating a few months ago and I turned around, because I told
you that watching people skate gave me a headache? I saw rows of bodies under the ice.
Your mother told me I could go home. I told her I didn't want to. She said, Have something
to eat. Try to sleep. I won't be able to eat or sleep. She said, I need to sleep. I told her
I loved her.
That made her cry, because she had been depending on me. I went back across the street.
130
Planes going into buildings. Bodies falling. Planes going into buildings. Buildings falling.
Planes going into buildings. Planes going into buildings. Planes going into buildings.
When I no longer had to be strong in front of you, I became very weak. I brought myself to
the ground, which was where I belonged. I hit the floor with my fists. I wanted to break
my hands, but when it hurt too much, I stopped. I was too selfish to break my hands for
my only child.
Bodies falling. Staples and tape.
I didn't feel empty. I wished I'd felt empty. People waving shirts out of high windows.
I wanted to be empty like an overturned pitcher. But I was full like a stone.
Planes going into buildings.
I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't want to get up. I wanted to lie in my own waste,
which is what I deserved. I wanted to be a pig in my own filth. But I got up and went to
the bathroom. That's who I am.
Bodies falling. Buildings falling.
The rings of the tree that fell away from our house. I wanted so much for it to be me under
the rubble. Even for a minute. A second. It was as simple as wanting to take his place. And
it was more complicated than that. The television was the only light. Planes going into
buildings. Planes going into buildings.
I thought it would feel different. But even then I was me. Oskar, I'm remembering you onstage
in front of all of those strangers. I wanted to say to them, He's mine. I wanted to
stand up and shout, That beautiful person is mine! Mine! When I was watching you, I was
so proud and so sad. Alas. His lips. Your songs.
When I looked at you, my life made sense. Even the bad things made sense. They were
necessary to make you possible. Alas. Your songs. My parents' lives made sense. My
grandparents'. Even Anna's life.
But I knew the truth, and that's why I was so sad. Every moment before this one depends
on this one. Everything in the history of the world can be proven wrong in one moment.
Your mother wanted to have a funeral, even though there was no body. What could anyone
say?
We all rode in the limousine together. I could not stop touching you. I could not touch you
enough. I needed more hands. You made jokes with the driver, but I could see that inside
you were suffering. Making him laugh was how you suffered. When we got to the grave
and they lowered the empty coffin, you let out a noise like an animal. I had never heard
anything like it. You were a wounded animal. The noise is still in my ears. It was what I
had spent forty years looking for, what I wanted my life and life story to be. Your mother
took you to the side and held you. They shoveled dirt into your father's grave. Onto my
son's empty coffin. There was nothing there. All of my sounds were lock inside me. The
limousine took us home. Everyone was silent.
When we got to my building, you walked me to the front door. The doorman said there
was a letter for me. I told him I'd look at it tomorrow or the next day. The doorman said
the person had just dropped it off. I said, Tomorrow.
131
The doorman said, He seemed desperate. I asked you to read it for me. I said, My eyes are
crummy. You opened it. I'm sorry, you said. Why are you sorry? No, that's what it says. I
took it from you and looked at it.
When your grandfather left me forty years ago, I erased all of his writing. I washed the
words from the mirrors and the floors. I painted over the walls. I cleaned the shower curtains.
I even refinished the floors. It took me as long as I had known him to get rid of all of
his words. Like turning an hourglass over.
I thought he had to look for what he was looking for, and realize it no longer existed, or
never existed. I thought he would write. Or send money. Or ask for pictures of the baby, if
not me. For forty years not a word. Only empty envelopes.
And then, on the day of my son's funeral, two words. I'm sorry. He had come back.
ALIVE AND ALONE
 We had been searching together for six and a half months when Mr. Black told me he was
finished, and then I was all alone again, and I hadn't accomplished anything, and my
boots were the heaviest they'd ever been in my life. I couldn't talk to Mom, obviously, and
even though Toothpaste and The Minch were my best friends, I couldn't talk to them either.
Grandpa could talk to animals, but I couldn't, so Buckminster wasn't going to be
helpful. I didn't respect Dr. Fein, and it would have taken too long to explain to Stan everything
that needed to be explained just to get to the beginning of the story, and I didn't
believe in talking to dead people.
Parley didn't know if Grandma was home, because his shift had just started. He asked if
something was wrong. I told him, 'I need her.'
'You want I should buzz up?'
'It's OK.' As I ran up the seventy-two stairs, I thought, And anyway, he was an incredibly old
guy who slowed me down and didn't know anything useful. I was breathing hard when I rang
her bell. I'm glad he said he was finished. I don't know why I invited him to come along with me in
the first place. She didn't answer, so I rang again. Why isn't she waiting by the door? I'm the
only thing that matters to her
.
I let myself in.
'Grandma? Hello? Grandma?'
I figured maybe she went to the store or something, so I sat on the sofa and waited. Maybe
she went to the park for a walk to help her digest, which I know she sometimes did, even
though it made me feel weird. Or maybe she was getting some dehydrated ice cream for
132
me, or dropping something off at the post office. But who would she send letters to?
Even though I didn't want to, I started inventing.
She'd been hit by a cab while she was crossing Broadway, and the cab zoomed away, and
everybody looked at her from the sidewalk, but no one helped her, because everyone was
afraid to do CPR the wrong way.
She'd fallen from a ladder at the library and cracked her skull. She was bleeding to death
there because it was in a section of books that no one ever looked at.
She was unconscious at the bottom of the swimming pool at the Y. Kids were swimming
thirteen feet above her.
I tried to think about other things. I tried to invent optimistic inventions. But the pessimistic
ones were extremely loud.
She'd had a heart attack.
Someone had pushed her onto the tracks.
She'd been raped and murdered.
I started looking around her apartment for her.
'Grandma?'
What I needed to hear was 'I'm OK,' but what I heard was nothing.
I looked in the dining room and the kitchen. I opened the door to the pantry, just in case,
but there was only food. I looked in the coat closet and the bathroom. I opened the door of
the second bedroom, where Dad used to sleep and dream when he was my age.
It was my first time being in Grandma's apartment without her, and it felt incredibly
weird, like looking at her clothes without her in them, which I did when I went to her bedroom
and looked in her closet. I opened the top drawer of the dresser, even though I knew
she wouldn't be in there, obviously. So why did I do it?
It was filled with envelopes. Hundreds of them. They were tied together in bundles. I
opened the next drawer down, and it was also filled with envelopes. So was the drawer
underneath it. All of them were.
I saw from the postmarks that the envelopes were organized chronologically, which
means by date, and mailed from Dresden, Germany, which is where she came from. There
was one for every day, from May 31, 1963, to the worst day. Some were addressed 'To my
unborn child.' Some were addressed 'To my child.'
What the?
 I knew I probably shouldn't have, because they didn't belong to me, but I opened one of
them.
It was sent on February 6, 1972. 'To my child.' It was empty.
I opened another, from another stack. November 22, 1986. 'To my child.' Also empty.
June 14, 1963. 'To my unborn child.' Empty.
April 2, 1979. Empty.
I found the day I was born. Empty.
133
What I needed to know was, where did she put all of the letters?
I heard a sound from one of the other rooms. I quickly closed the drawers, so Grandma
wouldn't know I had been snooping around, and tiptoed to the front door, because I was
afraid that maybe what I had heard was a burglar. I heard the sound again, and this time I
could tell that it was coming from the guest room.
I thought, The renter!
 I thought, He's real!
 I'd never loved Grandma more than I loved her right then.
I turned around, tiptoed to the guest room door, and pressed my ear against it. I didn't
hear anything. But when I got down on my knees, I saw that the light in the room was on.
I stood up.
'Grandma?' I whispered. 'Are you in there?'
Nothing.
'Grandma?'
I heard an extremely tiny sound. I got down on my knees again, and this time I saw that
the light was off.
'Is someone in there? I'm eight years old and I'm looking for my grandma because I need
her desperately.'
Footsteps came to the door, but I could only barely hear them because they were extremely
gentle and because of the carpet. The footsteps stopped. I could hear breathing,
but I knew it wasn't Grandma's, because it was heavier and slower. Something touched
the door. A hand? Two hands?
'Hello?'
The doorknob turned.
'If you're a burglar, please don't murder me.'
The door opened.
A man stood there without saying anything, and it was obvious he wasn't a burglar. He
was incredibly old and had a face like the opposite of Mom's, because it seemed like it was
frowning even when it wasn't frowning. He was wearing a white short-sleeve shirt, so you
could see his elbows were hairy, and he had a gap between his two front teeth, like Dad
had.
'Are you the renter?'
He concentrated for a second, and then he closed the door.
'Hello?'
I heard him moving stuff around in the room, and then he came back and opened the door
again. He was holding a little book. He opened it to the first page, which was blank. 'I
don't speak,' he wrote, 'I'm sorry.'
'Who are you?' He went to the next page and wrote, 'My name is Thomas.'
'That was my dad's name. It's pretty common. He died.' On the next page he wrote, 'I'm
134
sorry.' I told him, 'You didn't kill my dad.' On the next page there was a picture of a doorknob,
for some reason, so he went to the page after that and wrote, 'I'm still sorry.' I told
him, 'Thanks.' He flipped back a couple of pages and pointed at 'I'm sorry.'
We stood there. He was in the room. I was in the hall. The door was open, but it felt like
there was an invisible door between us, because I didn't know what to say to him, and he
didn't know what to write to me. I told him, 'I'm Oskar,' and I gave him my card. 'Do you
know where my grandma is?' He wrote, 'She went out.'
'Where?' He shrugged his shoulders, just like Dad used to. 'Do you know when she'll be
back?' He shrugged his shoulders. 'I need her.'
He was on one kind of carpet, I was on another. The line where they came together reminded
me of a place that wasn't in any borough.
'If you want to come in,' he wrote, 'we could wait for her together.' I asked him if he was a
stranger. He asked me what I meant. I told him, 'I wouldn't go in with a stranger.' He didn't
write anything, like he didn't know if he was a stranger or not. 'Are you older than seventy?'
He showed me his left hand, which had YES tattooed on it. 'Do you have a criminal
record?' He showed me his right hand, which had NO. 'What other languages do you
speak?' He wrote, 'German. Greek. Latin.'
'Parlez-vous franÃƒÂ§ais?' He opened and closed his left hand, which I think meant un feu
.
I went in.
There was writing on the walls, writing everywhere, like, 'I wanted so much to have a life,'
and 'Even just once, even for a second.' I hoped, for his sake, that Grandma never saw it.
He put down the book and picked up another one, for some reason.
'For how long have you been living here?' I asked. He wrote, 'How long did your grandmother
tell you I've been living here?'
'Well,' I said, 'since Dad died, I guess, so about two years.' He opened his left hand. 'Where
were you before that?'
'Where did your grandmother tell you I was before that?'
'She didn't.'
'I wasn't here.' I thought that was a weird answer, but I was getting used to weird answers.
He wrote, 'Do you want something to eat?' I told him no. I didn't like how much he was
looking at me, because it made me feel incredibly self-conscious, but there was nothing I
could say. 'Do you want something to drink?'
'What's your story?' I asked. 'What's my story?'
'Yeah, what's your story?' He wrote, 'I don't know what my story is.'
'How can you not know what your story is?' He shrugged his shoulders, just like Dad
used to. 'Where were you born?' He shrugged his shoulders. 'How can you not know
where you were born!' He shrugged his shoulders. 'Where did you grow up?' He
shrugged his shoulders. 'OK. Do you have any brothers or sisters?' He shrugged his
shoulders. 'What's your job? And if you're retired, what was
135
 your job?' He shrugged his shoulders. I tried to think of something I could ask him that he
couldn't not know the answer to. 'Are you a human being?' He flipped back and pointed at
'I'm sorry.'
I'd never needed Grandma more than I needed her right then.
I asked the renter, 'Can I tell you my story?'
He opened his left hand.
So I put my story into it.
I pretended he was Grandma, and I started at the very beginning.
I told him about the tuxedo on the chair, and how I had broken the vase, and found the
key, and the locksmith, and the envelope, and the art supply store. I told him about the
voice of Aaron Black, and how I was so incredibly close to kissing Abby Black. She didn't
say she didn't want to, just that it wasn't a good idea. I told him about Abe Black in Coney
Island, and Ada Black with the two Picasso paintings, and the birds that flew by Mr.
Black's window. Their wings were the first thing he'd heard in more than twenty years.
Then there was Bernie Black, who had a view of Gramercy Park, but not a key to it, which
he said was worse than looking at a brick wall. Chelsea Black had a tan line around her
ring finger, because she got divorced right after she got back from her honeymoon, and
Don Black was also an animal-rights activist, and Eugene Black also had a coin collection.
Fo Black lived on Canal Street, which used to be a real canal. He didn't speak very good
English, because he hadn't left Chinatown since he came from Taiwan, because there was
no reason for him to. The whole time I talked to him I imagined water on the other side of
the window, like we were in an aquarium. He offered me a cup of tea, but I didn't feel like
it, but I drank it anyway, to be polite. I asked him did he really love New York or was he
just wearing the shirt. He smiled, like he was nervous. I could tell he didn't understand,
which made me feel guilty for speaking English, for some reason. I pointed at his shirt.
'Do? You? Really? Love? New York?' He said, 'New York?' I said, 'Your. Shirt.' He looked
at his shirt. I pointed at the N and said 'New,' and the Y and said 'York.' He looked confused,
or embarrassed, or surprised, or maybe even mad. I couldn't tell what he was feeling,
because I couldn't speak the language of his feelings. 'I not know was New York. In
Chinese, ny
 mean 'you.' Thought was 'I love you.' It was then that I noticed the 'IÃ¢Â™Â¥NY' poster
on the wall, and the 'IÃ¢Â™Â¥NY' flag over the door, and the 'IÃ¢Â™Â¥NY' dishtowels,
and the 'IÃ¢Â™Â¥NY' lunchbox on the kitchen table. I asked him, 'Well, then why do you
love everybody so much?'
Georgia Black, in Staten Island, had turned her living room into a museum of her husband's
life. She had pictures of him from when he was a kid, and his first pair of shoes,
and his old report cards, which weren't as good as mine, but anyway. 'Y'all're the first visitors
in more than a year,' she said, and she showed us a neat gold medal in a velvet box.
'He was a naval officer, and I loved being a naval wife. Every few years we'd have to
travel to some exotic place. I never did get a chance to put down many roots, but it was
thrilling. We spent two years in the Philippines.'
'Cool
136
,' I said, and Mr. Black started singing a song in some weird language, which I guess was
Philippinish. She showed us her wedding album, one picture at a time, and said, 'Wasn't I
slim and beautiful?' I told her, 'You were.' Mr. Black said, 'And you are.' She said, 'Aren't
you two the sweetest?' I said, 'Yeah.'
'This is the three-wood that he hit his hole in one with. He was real proud of that. For
weeks it was all I'd hear about. That's the airplane ticket from our trip to Maui, Hawaii.
I'm not too vain to tell you it was our thirtieth anniversary. Thirty years. We were going to
renew our vows. Just like in a romance novel. His carry-on bag was filled with flowers,
bless his heart. He wanted to surprise me with them on the plane, but I was looking at the
x-ray screen as his bag went through, and don't you know there was a dark black bouquet.
It was like the shadows of flowers. What a lucky girl I am.' She used a cloth to wipe away
our fingerprints.
It had taken us four hours to get to her house. Two of those were because Mr. Black had to
convince me to get on the Staten Island Ferry. In addition to the fact that it was an obvious
potential target, there had also been a ferry accident pretty recently, and in Stuff That Happened
to Me
 I had pictures of people who had lost their arms and legs. Also, I don't like bodies of water.
Or boats, particularly. Mr. Black asked me how I would feel in bed that night if I didn't
get on the ferry. I told him, 'Heavy boots, probably.'
'And how will you feel if you did?'
'Like one hundred dollars.'
'So?'
'So what about while I'm on
 the ferry? What if it sinks? What if someone pushes me off? What if it's hit with a shoulder-fired
missile? There won't be a tonight tonight.' He said, 'In which case you won't feel
anything anyway.' I thought about that.
'This is an evaluation from his commanding officer,' Georgia said, tapping the case. 'It's
exemplary. This is the tie he wore to his mother's funeral, may she rest in peace. She was
such a nice woman. Nicer than most. And this here is a picture of his childhood home.
That was before I knew him, of course.' She tapped every case and then wiped away her
own fingerprints, kind of like a Mobius strip. 'These are his varsity letters. This is his cigarette
case from when he used to smoke. Here's his Purple Heart.'
I started to get heavy boots, for obvious reasons, like where were all of her things? Where
were her shoes and her
 diploma? Where were the shadows of her flowers? I made a decision that I wouldn't ask
about the key, because I wanted her to believe that we had come to see her museum, and I
think Mr. Black had the same idea. I decided to myself that if we went through the whole
list and still hadn't found anything, then maybe, if we had no choice, we could come back
and ask her some questions. 'These are his baby shoes.'
But then I started to wonder: she said we were the first visitors in a little more than a year.
Dad had died a little more than a year ago. Was he
137
 the visitor before us?
'Hello, everyone,' a man said from the door. He was holding two mugs, which steam was
coming out of, and his hair was wet. 'Oh, you're awake!' Georgia said, taking the mug that
said 'Georgia' on it. She gave him a big kiss, and I was like, What in the what the? 'Here he
is,' she said. 'Here who is?' Mr. Black asked. 'My husband,' she said, almost like he was another
exhibit in his life. The four of us stood there smiling at one another, and then the
man said, 'Well, I suppose you'd like to see my museum now.' I told him, 'We just did. It
was really great.' He said, 'No, Oskar, that's her
 museum. Mine's in the other room.'
Thank you for your letter. Because of the large volume of mail I receive, I am unable
to write personal responses. Nevertheless, know that I read and save every letter,
with the hope of one day being able to give each the proper response it deserves.
Until that day,
Most sincerely,
Stephen Hawking
The week passed quickly. Iris Black. Jeremy Black. Kyle Black. Lori BlackÃ¢Â€Â¦Mark
Black was crying when he opened the door and saw us, because he had been waiting for
someone to come back to him, so every time someone knocked on the door, he couldn't
stop himself from hoping it might be that person, even though he knew he shouldn't hope.
Nancy Black's roommate told us Nancy was at work at the coffee store on Nineteenth Street,
so we went there, and I explained to her that coffee actually has more caffeine than espresso,
even though a lot of people don't think so, because the water is in contact with the
grounds for a much longer time with coffee. She told me she didn't know that. 'If he says
it, it's true,' Mr. Black said, patting my head. I told her, 'Also, did you know that if you yell
for nine years, you'll produce enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee?' She said, 'I
didn't.' I said, 'Which is why they should put a coffee store next to the Cyclone at Coney Island

! Get it?' That made me crack up, but only me. She asked if we were going to order anything.
I told her, 'Iced coffee, please.' She asked, 'What size?' I said, 'Vente, and could you
please use coffee ice cubes so it doesn't get all watery when the ice cubes melt?' She told
me they didn't have coffee ice cubes. I said, 'Exactly.' Mr. Black said, 'I'm going to get right
to the point,' and then he did. I went to the bathroom and gave myself a bruise.
Ray Black was in prison, so we weren't able to talk to him. I did some research on the
Internet and found out that he was in prison because he murdered two kids after he raped
them. There were also pictures of the dead kids, and even though I knew it would only
hurt me to look at them, I did. I printed them out and put them in Stuff That Happened to
Me
, right after the picture of Jean-Pierre Haignere, the French astronaut who had to be carried
from his spacecraft after returning from the Mir space station, because gravity isn't only
what makes us fall, it's what makes our muscles strong. I wrote a letter to Ray Black in
prison, but I never got a response. Inside, I hoped he didn't have anything to do with the
key, although I couldn't help inventing that it was for his jail cell.
138
The address for Ruth Black was on the eighty-sixth floor of the Empire State Building,
which I thought was incredibly weird, and so did Mr. Black, because neither of us knew
that people actually lived there. I told Mr. Black that I was panicky, and he said it was OK
to be panicky. I told him I felt like I couldn't do it, and he said it was OK to feel like I
couldn't do it. I told him it was the thing that I was most afraid of. He said he could understand
why. I wanted him to disagree with me, but he wouldn't, so I had no way to argue. I
told him I would wait for him in the lobby, and he said, 'Fine.'
'OK, OK,' I said, 'I'll go.'
As the elevator takes you up, you hear information about the building, which was pretty
fascinating, and I normally would have taken some notes, but I needed all of my concentration
for being brave. I squeezed Mr. Black's hand, and I couldn't stop inventing: the elevator
cables snapping, the elevator falling, a trampoline at the bottom, us shooting back
up, the roof opening like a cereal box, us flying toward parts of the universe that not even
Stephen Hawking was sure aboutÃ¢Â€Â¦
When the elevator door opened, we got out on the observation deck. We didn't know who
to look for, so we just looked around for a while. Even though I knew the view was incredibly
beautiful, my brain started misbehaving, and the whole time I was imagining a
plane coming at the building, just below us. I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop. I imagined
the last second, when I would see the pilot's face, who would be a terrorist. I imagined
us looking each other in the eyes when the nose of the plane was one millimeter from
the building.
I hate you, my eyes would tell him.
I hate you, his eyes would tell me.
Then there would be an enormous explosion, and the building would sway, almost like it
was going to fall over, which I know is what it felt like from descriptions I've read on the
Internet, although I wish I hadn't read them. Then there would be smoke coming up at me
and people screaming all around me. I read one description of someone who made it
down eighty-five flights of stairs, which must have been about two thousand stairs, and he
said that people were screaming 'Help!' and 'I don't want to die!' and one man who owned
a company was screaming 'Mommy!'
It would be getting so hot that my skin would start to get blisters. It would feel so good to
get away from the heat, but on the other hand, when I hit the sidewalk I would die, obviously.
Which would I choose? Would I jump or would I burn? I guess I would jump, because
then I wouldn't have to feel pain. On the other hand, maybe I would burn, because
then I'd at least have a chance to somehow escape, and even if I couldn't, feeling pain is
still better than not feeling, isn't it?
I remembered my cell phone.
I still had a few seconds.
Who should I call?
What should I say?
I thought about all of the things that everyone ever says to each other, and how everyone
is going to die, whether it's in a millisecond, or days, or months, or 76.5 years, if you were
139
just born. Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers.
The smoke rises at different speeds, but they're all on fire, and we're all trapped.
You can see the most beautiful things from the observation deck of the Empire State Building.
I read somewhere that people on the street are supposed to look like ants, but that's
not true. They look like little people. And the cars look like little cars. And even the buildings
look little. It's like New York is a miniature replica of New York, which is nice, because
you can see what it's really like, instead of how it feels when you're in the middle of
it. It's extremely lonely up there, and you feel far away from everything. Also it's scary,
because there are so many ways to die. But it feels safe, too, because you're surrounded by
so many people. I kept one hand touching the wall as I walked carefully around to each of
the views. I saw all of the locks I'd tried to open, and the 161,999,831 that I hadn't yet.
I got down on my knees and crawled to one of the binocular machines. I held it tightly as I
pulled myself up, and I took a quarter from the change dispenser on my belt. When the
metal lids opened, I could see things that were far away incredibly close, like the Woolworth
Building, and Union Square, and the gigantic hole where the World Trade Center
was. I looked into the window of an office building that I guessed was about ten blocks
away. It took me a few seconds to figure out the focus, but then I could see a man sitting at
his desk, writing something. What was he writing? He didn't look at all like Dad, but he
reminded me of Dad. I pressed my face closer, and my nose got smooshed against the cold
metal. He was left-handed like Dad. Did he have a gap between his front teeth like Dad? I
wanted to know what he was thinking. Who did he miss? What was he sorry for? My lips
touched the metal, like a kiss.
I found Mr. Black, who was looking at Central Park. I told him I was ready to go down.
'But what about Ruth?'
'We can come back another day.'
'But we're already here.'
'I don't feel like it.'
'It'll just take a few – '
'I want to go home.' He could probably tell that I was about to cry. 'OK,' he said, 'let's go
home.'
We got at the end of the line for the elevator.
I looked at everyone and wondered where they came from, and who they missed, and
what they were sorry for.
There was a fat woman with a fat kid, and a Japanese guy with two cameras, and a girl
with crutches whose cast was signed by lots of people. I had a weird feeling that if I examined
it I would find Dad's writing. Maybe he would have written 'Get better soon.' Or just
his name. An old woman was standing a few feet away, staring back at me, which made
me self-conscious. She was holding a clipboard, although I couldn't see what was on it,
and she was dressed old-fashioned. I promised myself I wouldn't be the first to look away,
but I was. I pulled on Mr. Black's sleeve and told him to look at her. 'You know what,' he
whispered. 'What?'
'I bet you she's the one.' For some reason, I knew he was right. Although no part of me
140
wondered if maybe we were looking for different things.
'Should we go up to her?'
'Probably.'
'How?'
'I don't know.'
'Go say hello.'
'You can't just go say hello.'
'Tell her the time.'
'But she didn't ask the time.'
'Ask her the time.'
'You do it.'
'You
 do it.' We were so busy arguing about how to go up to her that we didn't even realize that
she had come up to us. 'I see that you're thinking about leaving,' she said, 'but could I interest
you in a very special tour of this very special building?'
'What's your name?' I asked. She said, 'Ruth.' Mr. Black said, 'We'd love a tour.'
She smiled, took a huge breath in, and then started walking while she talked. 'Construction
on the Empire State Building began in March of 1930, on the site of the old WaldorfAstoria
Hotel, at 350 Fifth Avenue at Thirty-fourth Street. It was completed one year and
forty-five days later – seven million man-hours of work, including Sundays and holidays.
Everything about the building was designed to expedite its construction – prefabricated
materials were used as much as possible – and as a result, work progressed at a rate of
about four and a half stories each week. The entire framework took less than half a year to
complete.' That was less time than how long I'd been searching for the lock.
She took a breath.
'Designed by the architectural firm of Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon Associates, the original
plan called for eighty-six stories, but a 150-foot mooring mast for zeppelins was added.
Today the mast is used for TV and radio broadcasts. The cost of the building, including the
land that it rests on, was $40,948,900. The cost of the building itself was $24,718,000, less
than half of the estimated cost of $50,000,000, due to deflated labor and materials costs
during the Great Depression.' I asked, 'What was the Great Depression?' Mr. Black said,
'I'll tell you later.'
'At 1,250 feet, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world until the
completion of the first tower of the World Trade Center in 1972. When the building was
opened, they had such a hard time finding tenants to rent space within it that New Yorkers
began calling it the Empty State Building.' That made me crack up. 'It was this observatory
that saved the building from going into bankruptcy.' Mr. Black patted the wall, like he
was proud of the observatory.
'The Empire State Building is supported by 60,000 tons of steel. It has approximately 6,500
windows and 10,000,000 bricks, weighing in the neighborhood of 365,000 tons.'
141
'That's a heavy neighborhood,' I said. 'More than 500,000 square feet of marble and Indiana
limestone encase this skyscraper. Inside, there is marble from France, Italy, Germany, and
Belgium. In fact, New York's most famous building is made with materials from just about
everywhere but New York, in much the same way that the city itself was made great by
immigrants.'
'Very true,' Mr. Black said, nodding his head.
'The Empire State Building has been the location of dozens of movies, the reception site of
foreign dignitaries, and even had a World War Two bomber crash into the seventy-ninth
floor in 1945.' I concentrated on happy, safe things, like the zipper on the back of Mom's
dress, and how Dad needed a drink of water whenever he whistled for too long. 'An elevator
fell to the bottom. You'll be relieved to know that the passenger was saved by the
emergency brakes.' Mr. Black gave my hand a squeeze. 'And speaking of elevators, there
are seventy of them in the building, including the six freight elevators. They travel at
speeds from 600 to 1,400 feet per minute. Or, if you so choose, you can walk the 1,860 steps
from the street level to the top.' I asked if you could also take the stairs down.
'On a clear day like this, you can see for eighty miles – well into Connecticut. Since the observatory
opened to the public in 1931, almost 110 million visitors have enjoyed the
breathtaking vision of the city beneath them. Each year, over 3.5 million people are
whisked to the eighty-sixth floor to be where Gary Grant waited in vain for Deborah Kerr
in An Affair to Remember, where Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan had their fateful meeting in the
movie Sleepless in Seattle
. Also, the observatory is handicap accessible.'
She stopped and put her hand on her heart.
'All in all, the feeling and spirit of New York City is embodied in the Empire State Building.
From the people who fell in love here, to the ones who have returned with their children
and grandchildren, everyone recognizes the building not only as an awe-inspiring
landmark which offers one of the most spectacular views on earth, but an unequaled symbol
of American ingenuity.'
She bowed. We clapped.
'Do you young men have another minute?'
'We have a lot of minutes,' Mr. Black said. 'Because that was the end of the official tour, but
there are a couple of things I really love about this building, and I only share them with
people I suspect will care.' I told her, 'We'll care incredibly much.'
'The dirigible mooring mast, now the base of the TV tower, was part of the original construction
of the building. One attempt to moor a privately owned blimp was successful.
But during another attempt, in September 1931, a navy blimp was almost upended, and
nearly swept
away the celebrities attending the historic affair, while the water ballast drenched pedestrians
several blocks away. The mooring mast idea was ultimately abandoned, although it
was very romantic.' She started walking again, and we followed her, but I wondered if she
would have kept talking even if we hadn't followed her. I couldn't tell if she was doing
what she was doing for us, or for herself, or for some completely other reason.
142
'During the spring and autumn bird-migration season, the lights that illuminate the tower
are turned off on foggy nights so they won't confuse birds, causing them to fly into the
building.' I told her, 'Ten thousand birds die every year from smashing into windows,' because
I'd accidentally found that fact when I was doing some research about the windows
in the Twin Towers. 'That's a lot of birds,' Mr. Black said. 'And a lot of windows,' Ruth
said. I told them, 'Yeah, so I invented a device that would detect when a bird is incredibly
close to a building, and that would trigger an extremely loud birdcall from another skyscraper,
and they'd be drawn to that. They'd bounce from one to another.'
'Like pinball,' Mr. Black said. 'What's pinball?' I asked. 'But the birds would never leave
Manhattan,' Ruth said. 'Which would be great,' I told her, 'because then your birdseed
shirt would be reliable.'
'Would it be all right if I mentioned the ten thousand birds in my future tours?' I told her
they didn't belong to me.
'A natural lightning rod, the Empire State Building is struck up to five hundred times each
year. The outdoor observation deck is closed during thunderstorms, but the inside viewing
areas remain open. Static electricity buildup is so mammoth on top of the building
that, under the right conditions, if you stick your hand through the observatory fence, St.
Elmo's fire will stream from your fingertips.'
'St. Elmo's fire is sooo awesome!'
'Lovers who kiss up here may find their lips crackling with electric sparks.' Mr. Black said,
'That's my favorite part.' She said, 'Mine, too.' I said, 'Mine's the St. Elmo's fire.'
'The Empire State Building is located at latitude 40 degrees, 44 minutes, 53.977 seconds
north; longitude 73 degrees, 59 minutes, 10.812 seconds west. Thank you.'
'That was delightful,' Mr. Black said. 'Thank you,' she said. I asked her how she knew all of
that stuff. She said, 'I know about this building because I love this building.' That gave me
heavy boots, because it reminded me of the lock that I still hadn't found, and how until I
found it, I didn't love Dad enough. 'What is it about this building?' Mr. Black asked. She
said, 'If I had an answer, it wouldn't really be love, would it?'
'You're a terrific lady,' he said, and then he asked where her family was from. 'I was born
in Ireland. My family came when I was a young girl.'
'Your parents?'
'My parents were Irish.'
'And your grandparents?'
'Irish.'
'That's marvelous news,' Mr. Black said. 'Why?' she asked, which was a question I was also
wondering. 'Because my family has nothing to do with Ireland. We came over on the Mayflower.'
I said, 'Cool
.' Ruth said, 'I'm not sure I understand.' Mr. Black said, 'We're not related.'
'Why would we be related?'
'Because we have the same last name.' Inside I thought, But technically she never actually said
her last name was Black. And even if it actually was Black, why wasn't she asking how he knew her
143
last name?
 Mr. Black took off his beret and got down onto one of his knees, which took him a long
time. 'At the risk of being too forthright, I was hoping I might have the pleasure of your
company one afternoon. I will be disappointed, but in no way offended, if you decline.'
She turned her face away. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'I shouldn't have.' She said, 'I stay up here.'
Mr. Black said, 'What the?
'
'I stay up here.'
'Always?'
'Yes.'
'For how long?'
'Oh. A long time. Years.' Mr. Black said, 'Jose!' I asked her how. 'What do you mean how?'
'Where do you sleep?'
'On nice nights, I'll sleep out here. But when it gets chilly, which is most nights up this
high, I have a bed in one of the storage rooms.'
'What do you eat?'
'There are two snack bars up here. And sometimes one of the young men will bring me
food, if I have a taste for something different. As you know, New York offers so many different
eating experiences.'
I asked if they knew she was up there. 'Who's they
?'
'I don't know, the people who own the building or whatever.'
'The building has been owned by a number of different people since I moved up here.'
'What about the workers?'
'The workers come and go. The new ones see I'm here and assume I'm supposed to be
here.'
'No one has told you to leave?'
'Never.'
'Why don't you go down?' Mr. Black asked. She said, 'I'm more comfortable here.'
'How could you be more comfortable here?'
'It's hard to explain.'
'How did it start?'
'My husband was a door-to-door salesman.'
'And?'
'This was in the old days. He was always selling something or other. He loved the next
thing that would change life. And he was always coming up with wonderful, crazy ideas.
A bit like you,' she said to me, which gave me heavy boots, because why couldn't I remind
people of me? 'One day he found a spotlight in an army surplus store. This was right after
144
the war and you could find just about anything. He hooked it up to a car battery and fixed
all of that to the crate he rolled around. He told me to go up to the observation deck of the
Empire State Building, and as he walked around New York, he'd occasionally shine the
light up at me so I could see where he was.'
'It worked?'
'Not during the day it didn't. It had to get quite dark before I could see the light, but once I
could, it was amazing. It was as if all of the lights in New York were turned off except for
his. That was how clearly I could see it.' I asked her if she was exaggerating. She said, 'I'm
understating.' Mr. Black said, 'Maybe you're telling it exactly as it was.'
'I remember that first night. I came up here and everyone was looking all over, pointing at
the things to see. There are so many spectacular things to see. But only I had something
pointing back at me.'
'Someone
,' I said. 'Yes, something that was someone. I felt like a queen. Isn't that funny? Isn't it
silly?' I shook my head no. She said, 'I felt just like a queen. When the light went off, I
knew his day was over, and I'd go down and meet him at home. When he died, I came
back up here. It's silly.'
'No,' I said. 'It isn't.'
'I wasn't looking for him. I'm not a girl. But it gave me the same feeling that I'd had when
it was daytime and I was looking for his light. I knew it was there, I just couldn't see it.'
Mr. Black took a step toward her.
'I couldn't bear to go home,' she said. I asked why not, even though I was afraid I was going
to learn something I didn't want to know. She said, 'Because I knew he wouldn't be
there.' Mr. Black told her thank you, but she wasn't done. 'I curled up in a corner that
night, that corner over there, and fell asleep. Maybe I wanted the guards to notice me. I
don't know. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I was all alone. It was cold. I was
scared. I walked to the railing. Right there. I'd never felt more alone. It was as if the building
had become much taller. Or the city had become much darker. But I'd never felt more
alive, either. I'd never felt more alive or alone.'
'I wouldn't make you go down,' Mr. Black said. 'We could spend the afternoon up here.'
'I'm awkward,' she said. 'So am I,' Mr. Black said. 'I'm not very good company. I just told
you everything I know.'
'I'm terrible company,' Mr. Black said, although that wasn't true. 'Ask him,' he said, pointing
at me. 'It's true,' I said, 'he sucks.'
'You can tell me about this building all afternoon. That would be marvelous. That's how I
want to spend my time.'
'I don't even have any lipstick.'
'Neither do I.' She let out a laugh, and then she put her hand over her mouth, like she was
angry at herself for forgetting her sadness.
It was already 2:32 P.M. when I finished walking the 1,860 stairs down to the lobby, and I
was exhausted, and Mr. Black seemed exhausted, too, so we went straight home. When we
145
got to Mr. Black's door – this was just a few minutes ago – I was already making plans for
next weekend, because we had to go to Far Rockaway, and Boerum Hill, and Long Island
City, and if we had time also to Dumbo, but he interrupted me and said, 'Listen. Oskar?'
'That's my name, don't wear it out.'
'I think I'm finished.'
'Finished with what?'
'I hope you understand.' He stuck out his hand for a shake. 'Finished with what?'
'I've loved being with you. I've loved every second of it. You got me back into the world.
That's the greatest thing anyone could have done for me. But now I think I'm finished. I
hope you understand.' His hand was still open, waiting for my hand.
I told him, 'I don't understand.'
I kicked his door and told him, 'You're breaking your promise.'
I pushed him and shouted, 'It isn't fair!'
I got on my tiptoes and put my mouth next to his ear and shouted, 'Fuck you!'
No. I shook his handÃ¢Â€Â¦
'And then I came straight here, and now I don't know what to do.'
As I had been telling the renter the story, he kept nodding his head and looking at my
face. He stared at me so hard that I wondered if he wasn't listening to me at all, or if he
was trying to hear something incredibly quiet underneath what I was saying, sort of like a
metal detector, but for truth instead of metal.
I told him, 'I've been searching for more than six months, and I don't know a single thing
that I didn't know six months ago. And actually I have negative knowledge, because I
skipped all of those French classes with Marcel. Also I've had to tell a googolplex lies,
which doesn't make me feel good about myself, and I've bothered a lot of people who I've
probably ruined my chances of ever being real friends with, and I miss my dad more now
than when I started, even though the whole point was to stop
 missing him.'
I told him, 'It's starting to hurt too much.'
He wrote, 'What is?'
Then I did something that surprised even me. I said, 'Hold on,' and I ran down the 72
stairs, across the street, right past Stan, even though he was saying 'You've got mail!' and
up the 105 stairs. The apartment was empty. I wanted to hear beautiful music. I wanted
Dad's whistling, and the scratching sound of his red pen, and the pendulum swinging in
his closet, and him tying his shoelaces. I went to my room and got the phone. I ran back
down the 105 stairs, past Stan, who was still saying 'You've got mail!,' back up the 72
stairs, and into Grandma's apartment. I went to the guest room. The renter was standing in
exactly the same position, like I'd never left, or never been there at all. I took the phone out
of the scarf that Grandma was never able to finish, plugged it in, and played those first
five messages for him. He didn't show anything on his face. He just looked at me. Not
even at me, but into me, like his detector sensed some enormous truth deep inside me.
146
'No one else has ever heard that,' I said.
'What about your mother?' he wrote.
'Especially not her.'
He crossed his arms and held his hands in his armpits, which for him was like putting his
hands over his mouth. I said, 'Not even Grandma,' and his hands started shaking, like
birds trapped under a tablecloth. Finally he let them go. He wrote, 'Maybe he saw what
happened and ran in to save somebody.'
'He would have. That's what he was like.'
'He was a good person?'
'He was the best person. But he was in the building for a meeting. And also he said he
went up to the roof, so he must have been above where the plane hit, which means he
didn't run in to save anyone.'
'Maybe he just said he was going to the roof.'
'Why would he do that?'
'What kind of meeting was it?'
'He runs the family jewelry business. He has meetings all the time.'
'The family jewelry business?'
'My grandpa started it.'
'Who's your grandpa?'
'I don't know. He left my grandma before I was born. She says he could talk to animals
and make a sculpture that was more real than the real thing.'
'What do you think?'
'I don't think anyone can talk to animals. Except to dolphins, maybe. Or sign language to
chimps.'
'What do you think about your grandpa?'
'I don't think about him.'
He pressed Play and listened to the messages again, and again I pressed Stop after the fifth
was finished.
He wrote, 'He sounds calm in the last message.' I told him, 'I read something in National
Geographic about how, when an animal thinks it's going to die, it gets panicky and starts to
act crazy. But when it knows
 it's going to die, it gets very, very calm.'
'Maybe he didn't want you to worry.' Maybe. Maybe he didn't say he loved me because
 he loved me. But that wasn't a good enough explanation. I said, 'I need to know how he
died.'
He flipped back and pointed at, 'Why?'
'So I can stop inventing how he died. I'm always inventing.'
He flipped back and pointed at, 'I'm sorry.'
147
'I found a bunch of videos on the Internet of bodies falling. They were on a Portuguese
site, where there was all sorts of stuff they weren't showing here, even though it happened
here. Whenever I want to try to learn about how Dad died, I have to go to a translator program
and find out how to say things in different languages, like 'September,' which is
'Wrzesieri,' or 'people jumping from burning buildings,' which is 'Menschen, die aus brennenden
Gebauden springen.' Then I Google those words. It makes me incredibly angry
that people all over the world can know things that I can't, because it happened here, and
happened to me, so shouldn't it be mine
?
'I printed out the frames from the Portuguese videos and examined them extremely
closely. There's one body that could be him. It's dressed like he was, and when I magnify it
until the pixels are so big that it stops looking like a person, sometimes I can see glasses.
Or I think I can. But I know I probably can't. It's just me wanting it to be him.'
'You want him to have jumped?'
'I want to stop inventing. If I could know how he died, exactly how he died, I wouldn't
have to invent him dying inside an elevator that was stuck between floors, which happened
to some people, and I wouldn't have to imagine him trying to crawl down the outside
of the building, which I saw a video of one person doing on a Polish site, or trying to
use a tablecloth as a parachute, like some of the people who were in Windows on the
World actually did. There were so many different ways to die, and I just need to know
which was his.'
He held out his hands like he wanted me to take them. 'Are those tattoos?' He closed his
right hand. I flipped back and pointed at 'Why?' He took back his hands and wrote, 'It's
made things easier. Instead of writing yes and no all the time, I can show my hands.'
'But why just YES and NO?'
'I only have two hands.'
'What about 'I'll think about it,' and 'probably,' and 'it's possible'?' He closed his eyes and
concentrated for a few seconds. Then he shrugged his shoulders, just like Dad used to.
'Have you always been silent?' He opened his right hand. 'Then why don't you talk?' He
wrote, 'I can't.'
'Why not?' He pointed at, 'I can't.'
'Are your vocal cords broken or something?'
'Something is broken.'
'When was the last time you talked?'
'A long, long time ago.'
'What was the last word you said?' He flipped back and pointed at 'I.'
'I
 was the last word you said?' He opened his left hand. 'Does that even count as a word?'
He shrugged his shoulders. 'Do you try to talk?'
'I know what will happen.'
148
'What?' He flipped back and pointed at, 'I can't.'
'Try.'
'Now?'
'Try to say something.' He shrugged his shoulders. I said, 'Please.'
He opened his mouth and put his fingers on his throat. They fluttered, like Mr. Black's fingers
looking for a one-word biography, but no sound came out, not even an ugly sound, or
breath.
I asked him, 'What were you trying to say?' He flipped back and pointed at, 'I'm sorry.' I
said, 'It's OK.' I said, 'Maybe your vocal cords actually are broken. You should go to a specialist.'
I asked him, 'What were you trying to say?' He pointed at, 'I'm sorry.'
I asked, 'Can I take a picture of your hands?'
He put his hands on his lap, face-up, like a book.
YES and NO.
I focused Grandpa's camera.
He kept his hands extremely still.
I took the picture.
I told him, 'I'm going to go home now.' He picked up his book and wrote, 'What about
your grandma?'
'Tell her I'll talk to her tomorrow.'
As I was halfway across the street, I heard clapping behind me, almost like the birds'
wings outside Mr. Black's window. I turned around and the renter was standing at the
building's door. He put his hand on his throat and opened his mouth, like he was trying to
speak again.
I called back to him, 'What are you trying to say?'
He wrote something in his book and held it up, but I couldn't see it, so I ran back over. It
said, 'Please don't tell your grandmother that we met.' I told him, 'I won't if you won't,'
and I didn't even wonder the obvious thing, which was why would he want to keep it a
secret? He wrote, 'If you ever need me for anything, just throw pebbles at the guest room
window. I'll come down and meet you under the streetlamp.' I said, 'Thanks.' Although
inside what I was thinking was, Why would I ever need you?
 All I wanted was to fall asleep that night, but all I could do was invent.
What about frozen planes, which could be safe from heat-seeking missiles?
What about subway turnstiles that were also radiation detectors?
What about incredibly long ambulances that connected every building to a hospital?
What about parachutes in fanny packs?
What about guns with sensors in the handles that could detect if you were angry, and if
you were, they wouldn't fire, even if you were a police officer?
What about Kevlar overalls?
What about skyscrapers made with moving parts, so they could rearrange themselves
149
when they had to, and even open holes in their middles for planes to fly through?
What aboutÃ¢Â€Â¦
What aboutÃ¢Â€Â¦
What aboutÃ¢Â€Â¦
And then a thought came into my brain that wasn't like the other thoughts. It was closer to
me, and louder. I didn't know where it came from, or what it meant, or if I loved it or
hated it. It opened up like a fist, or a flower.
What about digging up Dad's empty coffin?
WHY I'M NOT WHERE YOU ARE
 9/11/03
I don't speak, I'm sorry.
My name is Thomas.
I'm sorry.
I'm still sorry.
To my child: I wrote my last letter on the day you died, and I assumed I'd never write another
word to you, I've been so wrong about so much that I've assumed, why am I surprised
to feel the pen in my hand tonight? I'm writing as I wait to meet Oskar, in a little
less than an hour, I'll close this book and find him under the streetlight, we'll be on our
way to the cemetery, to you, your father and your son, this is how it happened. I gave a
note to your mother's doorman almost two years ago. I watched from across the street as
the limousine pulled up, she got out, she touched the door, she'd changed so much but I
still knew her, her hands had changed but the way she touched was the same, she went
into the building with a boy, I couldn't see if the doorman gave her my note, I couldn't see
her reaction, the boy came out and went into the building across the street. I watched her
that night as she stood with her palms against the window, I left another note with the
doorman, 'Do you want to see me again, or should I go away?' The next morning there
was a note written on the window, 'Don't go away,' which meant something, but it didn't
mean 'I want to see you again.' I gathered a handful of pebbles and tossed them at her
window, nothing happened, I tossed some more, but she didn't come to the window, I
wrote a note in my daybook – 'Do you want to see me again?' – I ripped it out and gave it
to the doorman, the next morning I went back, I didn't want to make her life any harder
than it was, but I didn't want to give up either, there was a note on the window, 'I don't
want to want to see you again,' which meant something, but it didn't mean yes. I gathered
150
pebbles from the street and threw them at her window, hoping she would hear me and
know what I meant, I waited, she didn't come to the window, I wrote a note – 'What
should I do?' – and gave it to the doorman, he said, 'I'll make sure she gets it,' I couldn't
say, 'Thank you.' The next morning I went back, there was a note on her window, the first
note, 'Don't go away,' I gathered pebbles, I threw them, they tapped like fingers against
the glass, I wrote a note, 'Yes or no?' for how long could it go on? The next day I found a
market on Broadway and bought an apple, if she didn't want me I would leave, I didn't
know where I would go, but I would turn around and walk away, there was no note on
her window, so I threw the apple, anticipating the glass that would rain down on me, I
wasn't afraid of the shards, the apple went through her window and into her apartment,
the doorman was standing in front of the building, he said, 'You're lucky that was open,
pal,' but I knew I wasn't lucky, he handed me a key. I rode the elevator up, the door was
open, the smell brought back to me what for forty years I had struggled not to remember
but couldn't forget. I put the key in my pocket, 'Only the guest room!' she called from our
bedroom, the room in which we used to sleep and dream and make love. That was how
we began our second life togetherÃ¢Â€Â¦When I got off the plane, after eleven hours of
travel and forty years away, the man took my passport and asked me the purpose of my
visit, I wrote in my daybook, 'To mourn,' and then, 'To mourn
 try to live,' he gave me a look and asked if I would consider that business or pleasure, I
wrote, 'Neither.'
'For how long do you plan to mourn and try to live?' I wrote, 'For the rest of my life.'
'So you're going to stay?'
'For as long as I can.'
'Are we talking about a weekend or a year?' I didn't write anything. The man said, 'Next.' I
watched the bags go around the carousel, each one held a person's belongings, I saw babies
going around and around, possible lives, I followed the arrows for those with nothing
to declare, and that made me want to laugh, but I was silent. One of the guards asked me
to come to the side, 'That's a lot of suitcases for someone with nothing to declare,' he said, I
nodded, knowing that people with nothing to declare carry the most, I opened the suitcases
for him, 'That's a lot of paper,' he said, I showed him my left palm, 'I mean, that's a
whole lot of paper.' I wrote, 'They're letters to my son. I wasn't able to send them to him
while he was alive. Now he's dead. I don't speak. I'm sorry.' The guard looked at the other
guard and they shared a smile, I don't mind if smiles come at my expense, I'm a small
price to pay, they let me through, not because they believed me but because they didn't
want to try to understand me, I found a pay phone and called your mother, that was as far
as my plan went, I assumed so much, that she was still alive, that she was in the same
apartment I'd left forty years before, I assumed she would come pick me up and everything
would begin to make sense, we would mourn and try to live, the phone rang and
rang, we would forgive ourselves, it rang, a woman answered, 'Hello?' I knew it was her,
the voice had changed but the breath was the same, the spaces between the words were
the same, I pressed '4, 3, 5, 5, 6,' she said, 'Hello?' I asked, '4, 7, 4, 8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5, 9, 9, 6, 8?'
She said, 'Your phone isn't one hundred dollars. Hello?' I wanted to reach my hand
through the mouthpiece, down the line, and into her room, I wanted to reach YES, I asked,
151
'4, 7,4,8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5,9,9,6, 8?' She said, 'Hello?' I told her, '4, 3, 5, 7!'
'Listen,' she said, 'I don't know what's wrong with your phone, but all I hear is beeps. Why
don't you hang up and try again.' Try again? I was trying to try again, that's what I was
doing! I knew it wouldn't help, I knew no good would come of it, but I stood there in the
middle of the airport, at the beginning of the century, at the end of my life, and I told her
everything: why I'd left, where I'd gone, how I'd found out about your death, why I'd
come back, and what I needed to do with the time I had left. I told her because I wanted
her to believe me and understand, and because I thought I owed it to her, and to myself,
and to you, or was it just more selfishness? I broke my life down into letters, for love I
pressed '5, 6, 8, 3,' for death, '3, 3, 2, 8, 4,' when the suffering is subtracted from the joy,
what remains? What, I wondered, is the sum of my life? '6,9,6, 2, 6, 3,4, 7, 3, 5,4, 3, 2, 5, 8, 6,
2, 6, 3,4, 5, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7,4, 8, 3, 3. 2 8, 8,4, 3, 2,4, 7, 7, 6, 7, 8, 4, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 3,4, 6, 3, 6, 7, 3,4,

It took me a long time, I don't know how long, minutes, hours, my heart got tired, my finger
did, I was trying to destroy the wall between me and my life with my finger, one press
at a time, my quarter ran out, or she hung up, I called again, '4, 7,4, 8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5,9,9,6, 8?'
She said, 'Is this a joke?' A joke, it wasn't a joke, what is a joke, was it a joke? She hung up,
I called again, '8, 4, 4, 7, 4, 7, 6, 6, 8, 2, 5, 6, 5, 3!' She asked, 'Oskar?' That was the first time I
ever heard his nameÃ¢Â€Â¦I was in Dresden's train station when I lost everything for the
second time, I was writing you a letter that I knew I never would send, sometimes I wrote
from there, sometimes from here, sometimes from the zoo, I didn't care about anything except
for the letter I was writing to you, nothing else existed, it was like when I walked to
Anna with my head down, hiding myself from the world, which is why I walked into her,
and why I didn't notice that people were gathering around the televisions. It wasn't until
the second plane hit, and someone who didn't mean to holler hollered, that I looked up,
there were hundreds of people around the televisions now, where had they come from? I
stood up and looked, I didn't understand what I was seeing on the screen, was it a commercial,
a new movie? I wrote, 'What's happened?' and showed it to a young businessman
watching the television, he took a sip of his coffee and said, 'No one knows yet,' his coffee
haunts me, his 'yet' haunts me. I stood there, a person in a crowd, was I watching the images,
or was something more complicated happening? I tried to count the floors above
where the planes had hit, the fire had to burn up through the buildings, I knew that those
people couldn't be saved, and how many were on the planes, and how many were on the
street, I thought and thought. On my walk home I stopped in front of an electronics store,
the front window was a grid of televisions, all but one of them were showing the buildings,
the same images over and over, as if the world itself were repeating, a crowd had
gathered on the sidewalk, one television, off to the side, was showing a nature program, a
lion was eating a flamingo, the crowd became noisy, someone who didn't mean to holler
hollered, pink feathers, I looked at one of the other televisions and there was only one
building, one hundred ceilings had become one hundred floors, which had become nothing,
I was the only one who could believe it, the sky was filled with paper, pink feathers.
The cafes were full that afternoon, people were laughing, there were lines in front of the
movie theaters, they were going to see comedies, the world is so big and small, in the same
moment we were close and far. In the days and weeks that followed, I read the lists of the
dead in the paper: mother of three, college sophomore, Yankees fan, lawyer, brother, bond
trader, weekend magician, practical joker, sister, philanthropist, middle son, dog lover,
janitor, only child, entrepreneur, waitress, grandfather of fourteen, registered nurse, ac-
153
countant, intern, jazz saxophonist, doting uncle, army reservist, late-night poet, sister,
window washer, Scrabble player, volunteer fireman, father, father, elevator repairman,
wine aficionado, office manager, secretary, cook, financier, executive vice president, bird
watcher, father, dishwasher, Vietnam veteran, new mother, avid reader, only child, competitive
chess player, soccer coach, brother, analyst, maitre d', black belt, CEO, bridge
partner, architect, plumber, public relations executive, father, artist in residence, urban
planner, newlywed, investment banker, chef, electrical engineer, new father who had a
cold that morning and thought about calling in sickÃ¢Â€Â¦and then one day I saw it,
Thomas Schell, my first thought was that I had died. 'He leaves behind a wife and son,' I
thought, my son, I thought, my grandson, I thought and thought and thought, and then I
stopped thinkingÃ¢Â€Â¦When the plane descended and I saw Manhattan for the first
time in forty years, I didn't know if I was going up or down, the lights were stars, I didn't
recognize any of the buildings, I told the man, 'To mourn
try to live,' I declared nothing, I called your mother but I couldn't explain myself, I called
again, she thought it was a joke, I called again, she asked, 'Oskar?' I went to the magazine
stand and got more quarters, I tried again, it rang and rang, I tried again, it rang, I waited
and tried again, I sat on the ground, not knowing what would happen next, not even
knowing what I wanted to happen next, I tried once more, 'Hello, you have reached the
Schell residence. I am speaking like an answering message, even though it's really me on
the phone. If you'd like to talk to me or Grandma, please begin at the beep sound I'm
about to make. Beeeeep. Hello?' It was a child's voice, a boy's. 'It's really me. I'm here. Bonjour?'
I hung up. Grandma? I needed time to think, a taxi would be too quick, as would a
bus, what was I afraid of? I put the suitcases on a pushcart and started walking, I was
amazed that no one tried to stop me, not even as I pushed the cart onto the street, not even
as I pushed it onto the side of the highway, with each step it became brighter and hotter,
after only a few minutes it was clear I wouldn't be able to manage, I opened one of the
suitcases and took out a stack of letters, 'To my child,' they were from 1977, 'To my child,'
'To my child,' I thought about laying them on the road beside me, creating a trail of things
I wasn't able to tell you, it might have made my load possible, but I couldn't, I needed to
get them to you, to my child. I hailed a cab, by the time we reached your mother's apartment
it was already getting late, I needed to find a hotel, I needed food and a shower and
time to think, I ripped a page from the daybook and wrote, 'I'm sorry,' I handed it to the
doorman, he said, 'Who's this for?' I wrote, 'Mrs. Schell,' he said, 'There is no Mrs. Schell,' I
wrote, 'There is,' he said, 'Believe me, I'd know if there was a Airs. Schell in this building,'
but I'd heard her voice on the phone, could she have moved and kept the number, how
would I find her, I needed a phone book. I wrote '3D' and showed it to the doorman. He
said, 'Ms. Schmidt,' I took back my book and wrote, 'That was her maiden name.'Ã¢Â€Â¦I
lived in the guest room, she left me meals by the door, I could hear her footsteps and
sometimes I thought I heard the rim of a glass against the door, was it a glass I once drank
water from, had it ever touched your lips? I found my daybooks from before I left, they
were in the body of the grandfather clock, I'd have thought she would have thrown them
away, but she kept them, many were empty and many were filled, I wandered through
them, I found the book from the afternoon we met and the book from the day after we got
married, I found our first Nothing Place, and the last time we walked around the reser-
154
voir, I found pictures of banisters and sinks and fireplaces, on top of one of the stacks was
the book from the first time I tried to leave, 'I haven't always been silent, I used to talk and
talk and talk and talk.' I don't know if she began to feel sorry for me, or sorry for herself,
but she started paying me short visits, she wouldn't say anything at first, only tidy up the
room, brush cobwebs from the corners, vacuum the carpet, straighten the picture frames,
and then one day, as she dusted the bedside table, she said, 'I can forgive you for leaving,
but not for coming back,' she walked out and closed the door behind her, I didn't see her
again for three days, and then it was as if nothing had been said, she replaced a light bulb
that had worked fine, she picked things up and put them down, she said, 'I'm not going to
share this grief with you,' she closed the door behind her, was I the prisoner or the guard?
Her visits became longer, we never had conversations, and she didn't like to look at me,
but something was happening, we were getting closer, or farther apart, I took a chance, I
asked if she would pose for me, like when we first met, she opened her mouth and nothing
came out, she touched my left hand, which I hadn't realized was in a fist, was that how
she said yes, or was that how she touched me? I went to the art supply store to buy some
clay, I couldn't keep my hands to myself, the pastels in long boxes, the palette knives, the
handmade papers hanging on rolls, I tested every sample, I wrote my name in blue pen
and in green oil stick, in orange crayon and in charcoal, it felt like I was signing the contract
of my life. I was there for more than an hour, although I bought only a simple block
of clay, when I came home she was waiting for me in the guest room, she was in a robe,
standing beside the bed, 'Did you make any sculptures while you were away?' I wrote that
I had tried but couldn't, 'Not even one?' I showed her my right hand, 'Did you think about
sculptures? Did you make them in your head?' I showed her my left hand, she took off her
robe and went onto the sofa, I couldn't look at her, I took the clay from the bag and set it
up on the card table, 'Did you ever make a sculpture of me in your head?' I wrote, 'How
do you want to pose?' She said the whole point was that I should choose, I asked if the
carpeting was new, she said, 'Look at me,' I tried but I couldn't, she said, 'Look at me or
leave me. But don't stay and look at anything else.' I asked her to lie on her back, but that
wasn't right, I asked her to sit, it wasn't right, cross your arms, turn your head away from
me, nothing was right, she said, 'Show me how,' I went over to her, I undid her hair, I
pressed down on her shoulders, I wanted to touch her across all of those distances, she
said, 'I haven't been touched since you left. Not in that way.' I pulled back my hand, she
took it into hers and pressed it against her shoulder, I didn't know what to say, she asked,
'Have you?' What's the point of a lie that doesn't protect anything? I showed her my left
hand. 'Who touched you?' My daybook was filled, so I wrote on the wall, 'I wanted so
much to have a life.'
'Who?' I couldn't believe the honesty as it traveled down my arm and came out my pen, 'I
paid for it.' She didn't lose her pose, 'Were they pretty?'
'That wasn't the point.'
'But were they?'
'Some of them.'
'So you just gave them money and that was it?'
'I liked to talk to them. I talked about you.'
155
'Is that supposed to make me feel good?' I looked at the clay. 'Did you tell them that I was
pregnant when you left?' I showed her my left hand. 'Did you tell them about Anna?' I
showed her my left hand. 'Did you care for any of them?' I looked at the clay, she said, 'I
love that you are telling me the truth,' and she took my hand from her shoulder and
pressed it between her legs, she didn't turn her head to the side, she didn't close her eyes,
she stared at our hands between her legs, I felt like I was killing something, she undid my
belt and unzipped my pants, she reached her hand under my underpants, 'I'm nervous,' I
said, by smiling, 'It's OK,' she said, 'I'm sorry,' I said, by smiling, 'It's OK,' she said, she
closed the door behind her, then opened it and asked, 'Did you ever make a sculpture of
me in your head?'Ã¢Â€Â¦There won't be enough pages in this book for me to tell you
what I need to tell you, I could write smaller, I could slice the pages down their; edges to
make two pages, I could write over my own writing, but then what? Every afternoon
someone would come to the apartment, I could hear the door opening, and the footsteps,
little footsteps, I heard talking, a child's voice, almost a song, it was the voice I'd heard
when I called from the airport, the two of them would talk for hours, I asked her one evening,
when she came to pose, who paid her all of those visits, she said, 'My grandson.'
'I have a grandson.'
'No,' she said, 'I have a grandson.'
'What's his name?' We tried again, we took off each other's clothes with the slowness of
people who know how easy it is to be proven wrong, she lay face-down on the bed, her
waist was irritated from pants that hadn't fit her in years, her thighs were scarred, I
kneaded them with YES and NO, she said, 'Don't look at anything else,' I spread her legs,
she inhaled, I could stare into the most private part of her and she couldn't see me looking,
I slid my hand under her, she bent her knees, I closed my eyes, she said, 'Lie on top of me,'
there was nowhere to write that I was nervous, she said, 'Lie on top of me.' I was afraid I'd
crush her, she said, 'All of you on all of me,' I let myself sink into her, she said, 'That's what
I've wanted,' why couldn't I have left it like that, why did I have to write anything else, I
should have broken my fingers, I took a pen from the bedside table and wrote 'Can I see
him?' on my arm. She turned over, spilling my body next to her, 'No.' I begged with my
hands. 'No.'
'Please.'
'Please.'
'I won't let him know who I am. I just want to see him.'
'No.'
'Why not?'
'Because.'
'Because why?'
'Because I changed his diapers. And I couldn't sleep on my stomach for two years. And I
taught him how to speak. And I cried when he cried. And when he was unreasonable, he
yelled at me.'
'I'll hide in the coat closet and look through the keyhole.' I thought she would say no, she
said, 'If he ever sees you, you will have betrayed me.' Did she feel pity for me, did she
156
want me to suffer? The next morning, she led me to the coat closet, which faces the living
room, she went in with me, we were in there all day, although she knew he wouldn't come
until the afternoon, it was too small, we needed more space between us, we needed Nothing
Places, she said, 'This is what it's felt like, except you weren't here.' We looked at each
other in silence for hours. When the bell rang, she went to let him in, I was on my hands
and knees so my eye would be at the right level, through the keyhole I saw the door open,
those white shoes, 'Oskar!' she said, lifting him from the ground, 'I'm OK,' he said, that
song, in his voice I heard my own voice, and my father's and grandfather's, and it was the
first time I'd heard your voice, 'Oskar!' she said again, lifting him again, I saw his face,
Anna's eyes, 'I'm OK,' he said again, he asked her where she had been, 'I was talking to the
renter,' she said. The renter? 'Is he still here?' he asked, 'No,' she said, 'he had to go run
some errands.'
'But how did he get out of the apartment?'
'He left right before you came.'
'But you said you were just talking to him.' He knew about me, he didn't know who I was,
but he knew someone was there, and he knew she wasn't telling the truth, I could hear it
in his voice, in my voice, in your voice, I needed to talk to him, but what did I need to say?
I'm your grandfather, I love you, I'm sorry? Maybe I needed to tell him the things I couldn't
tell you, give him all the letters that were supposed to be for your eyes. But she would
never give me her permission, and I wouldn't betray her, so I started to think about other
waysÃ¢Â€Â¦What am I going to do, I need more room, I have things I need to say, my
words are pushing at the walls of the paper's edge, the next day, your mother came to the
guest room and posed for me, I worked the clay with YES and NO, I made it soft, I pressed
my thumbs into her cheeks, bringing her nose forward, leaving my thumbprints, I carved
out pupils, I strengthened her brow, I hollowed out the space between her bottom lip and
chin, I picked up a daybook and went over to her. I started to write about where I'd been
and what I'd done since I left, how I'd made my living, whom I'd spent my time with,
what I'd thought about and listened to and eaten, but she ripped the page from the book, 'I
don't care,' she said, I don't know if she really didn't care or if it was something else, on the
next blank page I wrote, 'If there's anything you want to know, I'll tell you,' she said, 'I
know it will make your life easier to tell me, but I don't want to know anything.' How
could that be? I asked her to tell me about you, she said, 'Not our son, my son,' I asked her
to tell me about her son, she said, 'Every Thanksgiving I made a turkey and pumpkin pie. I
would go to the schoolyard and ask the children what toys they liked. I bought those for
him. I wouldn't let anyone speak a foreign language in the apartment. But he still became
you.'
'He became me?'
'Everything was yes and no.'
'Did he go to college?'
'I begged him to stay close, but he went to California. In that way he was also like you.'
'What did he study?'
'He was going to be a lawyer, but he took over the business. He hated jewelry.'
157
'Why didn't you sell it?'
'I begged him. I begged him to be a lawyer.'
'Then why?'
'He wanted to be his own father.' I'm sorry, if that's true, the last thing I would have
wanted was for you to be like me, I left so you could be you. She said, 'He tried to find you
once. I gave him that only letter you ever sent. He was obsessed with it, always reading it.
I don't know what you wrote, but it made him go and look for you.' On the next blank
page I wrote, 'I opened the door one day and there he was.'
'He found you?'
'We talked about nothing.'
'I didn't know he found you.'
'He wouldn't tell me who he was. He must have become nervous. Or he must have hated
me once he saw me. He pretended to be a journalist. It was so terrible. He said he was doing
a story about the survivors of Dresden.'
'Did you tell him what happened to you that night?'
'It was in the letter.'
'What did you write?'
'You didn't read it?'
'You didn't send it to me.'
'It was terrible. All of the things we couldn't share. The room was filled with conversations
we weren't having.' I didn't tell her that after you left, I stopped eating, I got so skinny that
the bathwater would collect between my bones, why didn't anyone ask me why I was so
skinny? If someone had asked, I never would have eaten another bite. 'But if he didn't tell
you he was your son, how did you know?'
'I knew because he was my son.' She put her hand on my chest, over my heart, I put my
hands on her thighs, I put my hands around her, she undid my pants, 'I'm nervous,' despite
everything I wanted, the sculpture was looking more and more like Anna, she closed
the door behind her, I'm running out of roomÃ¢Â€Â¦I spent most of my days walking
around the city, getting to know it again, I went to the old Columbian Bakery but it wasn't
there anymore, in its place was a ninety-nine-cent store where everything cost more than
ninety-nine, cents. I went by the tailor shop where I used to get my pants taken in, but
there was a bank, you needed a card just to open the door, I walked for hours, down one
side of Broadway and up the other, where there had been a watch repairman there was a
video store, where there had been a flower market there was a store for video games,
where there had been a butcher there was sushi, what's sushi, and what happens to all of
the broken watches? I spent hours at the dog run on the side of the natural history museum,
a pit bull, a Labrador, a golden retriever, I was the only person without a dog, I
thought and thought, how could I be close to Oskar from far away, how could I be fair to
you and fair to your mother and fair to myself, I wanted to carry the closet door with me
so I could always look at him through the keyhole, I did the next best thing. I learned his
life from a distance, when he went to school, when he came home, where his friends lived,
158
what stores he liked to go to, I followed him all over the city, but I didn't betray your
mother, because I never let him know I was there. I thought it could go on like that forever,
and yet here I am, once again I was proven wrong. I don't remember when the
strangeness of it first occurred to me, how much he was out, how many neighborhoods he
went to, why I was the only one watching him, how his mother could let him wander so
far so alone. Every weekend morning, he left the building with an old man and went
knocking on doors around the city, I made a map of where they went, but I couldn't make
sense of it, it made no sense, what were they doing? And who was the old man, a friend, a
teacher, a replacement for a missing grandfather? And why did they stay for only a few
minutes at each apartment, were they selling something, collecting information? And what
did his grandmother know, was I the only one worried about him? After they left one
house, on Staten Island, I waited around and knocked on the door, 'I can't believe it,' the
woman said, 'another visitor!'
'I'm sorry,' I wrote, 'I don't speak. That was my grandson who just left. Could you tell me
what he was doing here?' The woman told me, 'What a strange family you are.' I thought,
Family we are.
'I just got off the phone with his mother.' I wrote, 'Why was he here?' She said, 'For the
key.' I asked, 'What key?' She said, 'For the lock.'
'What lock?'
'Don't you know?' For eight months I followed him and talked to the people he talked to, I
tried to learn about him as he tried to learn about you, he was trying to find you, just as
you'd tried to find me, it broke my heart into more pieces than my heart was made of, why
can't people say what they mean at the time? One afternoon I followed him downtown, we
sat across from each other on the subway, the old man looked at me, was I staring, was I
reaching my arms out in front of me, did he know that I should have been the one sitting
next to Oskar? They went into a coffee store, on the way back I lost them, it happened all
the time, it's hard to stay close without making yourself known, and I wouldn't betray her.
When I got back to the Upper West Side I went into a bookstore, I couldn't go to the
apartment yet, I needed time to think, at the end of the aisle I saw a man who I thought
might be Simon Goldberg, he was also in the children's section, the more I looked at him,
the more unsure I was, the more I wanted it to be him, had he gone to work instead of to
his death? My hands shook against the change in my pockets, I tried not to stare, I tried
not to reach my arms out in front of me, could it be, did he recognize me, he'd written, 'It
is my great hope that our paths, however long and winding, will cross again.' Fifty years
later he wore the same thick glasses, I'd never seen a whiter shirt, he had a hard time letting
go of books, I went up to him. 'I don't speak,' I wrote, 'I'm sorry.' He wrapped his
arms around me and squeezed, I could feel his heart beating against my heart, they were
trying to beat in unison, without saying a word he turned around and rushed away from
me, out of the store, into the street, I'm almost sure it wasn't him, I want an infinitely long
blank book and the rest of timeÃ¢Â€Â¦The next day, Oskar and the old man went to the
Empire State Building, I waited for them on the street. I kept looking up, trying to see him,
my neck was burning, was he looking down at me, were we sharing something without
either of us knowing it? After an hour, the elevator doors opened and the old man came
159
out, was he going to leave Oskar up there, so high up, so alone, who would keep him safe?
I hated him. I started to write something, he came up to me and grabbed me by the collar.
'Listen,' he said, 'I don't know who you are, but I've seen you following us, and I don't like
it. Not a bit. This is the only time I'm going to tell you to stay away.' My book had fallen to
the floor, so I couldn't say anything. 'If I ever see you again, anywhere near that boy – ' I
pointed at the floor, he let go of my collar, I picked up the book and wrote, 'I'm Oskar's
grandfather. I don't speak. I'm sorry.'
'His grandfather?' I flipped back and pointed at what I'd been writing, 'Where is he?'
'Oskar doesn't have a grandfather.' I pointed at the page. 'He's walking down the stairs.' I
quickly explained everything as best I could, my handwriting was becoming illegible, he
said, 'Oskar wouldn't lie to me.' I wrote, 'He didn't lie. He doesn't know.' The old man took
a necklace from under his shirt and looked at it, the pendant was a compass, he said, 'Oskar
is my friend. I have to tell him.'
'He's my grandson. Please don't.'
'You're the one who should be going around with him.'
'I have been.'
'And what about his mother?'
'What about his mother?' We heard Oskar singing from around the corner, his voice was
getting louder, the old man said, 'He's a good boy,' and walked away. I went straight
home, the apartment was empty. I thought about packing my bags, I thought about jumping
out a window, I sat on the bed and thought, I thought about you. What kind of food
did you like, what was your favorite song, who was the first girl you kissed, and where,
and how, I'm running out of room, I want an infinitely long blank book and forever, I
don't Ã‚Â know how much time passed, it didn't matter, I'd lost all of my reasons to keep
track. Someone rang the bell, I didn't get up, I didn't care who it was, I wanted to be alone,
on the other side of the window. I heard the door open and I heard his voice, my reason,
'Grandma?' He was in the apartment, it was just the two of us, grandfather and grandson.
I heard him going from room to room, moving things, opening and closing, what was he
looking for, why was he always looking? He came to my door, 'Grandma?' I didn't want to
betray her, I turned off the lights, what was I so afraid of? 'Grandma?' He started crying,
my grandson was crying. 'Please. I really need help. If you're in there, please come out.' I
turned on the light, why wasn't I more afraid? 'Please.' I opened the door and we faced
each other, I faced myself, 'Are you the renter?' I went back into the room and got this
daybook from the closet, this book that is nearly out of pages, I brought it to him and
wrote, 'I don't speak. I'm sorry.' I was so grateful to have him looking at me, he asked me
who I was, I didn't know what to tell him, I invited him into the room, he asked me if I
was a stranger, I didn't know what to tell him, he was still crying, I didn't know how to
hold him, I'm running out of room. I brought him over to the bed, he sat down, I didn't ask
him any questions or tell him what I already knew, we didn't talk about unimportant
things, we didn't become friends, I could have been anyone, he began at the beginning, the
vase, the key, Brooklyn, Queens, I knew the lines by heart. Poor child, telling everything to
a stranger, I wanted to build walls around him, I wanted to separate inside from outside, I
wanted to give him an infinitely long blank book and the rest of time, he told me how he'd
160
just gone up to the top of the Empire State Building, how his friend had told him he was
finished, it wasn't what I'd wanted, but if it was necessary to bring my grandson face to
face with me, it was worth it, anything would have been. I wanted to touch him, to tell
him that even if everyone left everyone, I would never leave him, he talked and talked, his
words fell through him, trying to find the floor of his sadness, 'My dad,' he said, 'My dad,'
he ran across the street and came back with a phone, 'These are his last words.'

HAPPENS,
REMEMBER –
The message was cut off, you sounded so calm, you didn't sound like someone who was
about to die, I wish we could have sat across a table and talked about nothing for hours, I
wish we could have wasted time, I want an infinitely blank book and the rest of time. I
told Oskar it was best not to let his grandma know we'd met, he didn't ask why, I wonder
what he knew, I told him if he ever wanted to talk to me, he could throw pebbles at the
guest room window and I would come down to meet him on the corner, I was afraid I'd
never get to see him again, to see him seeing me, that night was the first time your mother
and I made love since I returned, and the last time we ever made love, it didn't feel like the
last time, I'd kissed Anna for me last time, seen my parents for the last time, spoken for the
last time, why didn't I learn to treat everything like it was the last time, my greatest regret
is how much I believed in the future, she said, 'I want to show you something,' she led me
to the second bedroom, her hand was squeezing YES, she opened the door and pointed at
the bed, 'That's where he used to sleep,' I touched the sheets, I lowered myself to the floor
and smelled the pillow, I wanted anything of you that I could have, I wanted dust, she
said, 'Years and years ago. Thirty years. I lay on the bed, I wanted to feel what you felt, I
wanted to tell you everything, she lay next to me, she asked, 'Do you believe in heaven
161
and hell?' I held up my right hand, 'Neither do I,' she said, 'I think after you live it's like
before you lived, her hand was open, I put YES into it, she dosed her fingers around mine,
she said, 'Think of all the things that haven't been born yet. All the babies. Some never will
be born. Is that sad?' I didn't know if it was sad, all the parents that would never meet, all
the miscarriages, I closed my eyes, she: said, 'A few days, before the bombing, my father
took me out to the shed. He gave me a sip of whiskey and let me try his pipe. It made me
feel so adult, so special. He asked me what I knew about sex. I coughed and coughed. He
laughed and laughed and became serious. He asked if I knew how to pack a suitcase, and
if I knew never to accept the first offer, and if I could start a fire if I had to. I loved my father
very much. I loved him very, very much. But I never found a way to tell him. I turned
my head to the side, I rested it on her shoulder, she put her hand on my cheek, just like my
mother used to, everything she did reminded me of 'someone else, 'It's a shame,' she said,
'that life is so precious.' I turned onto my side and put my arm around her, I'm running
out of room, my eyes were closed and I kissed her, her lips were my mother's lips, and
Anna's lips, and your lips, I didn't know how to be with her and be with her. 'It makes us
worry so much, she said, unbuttoning her shirt, I unbuttoned mine, she took off her pants,
I took off mine, 'We worry so much,' I touched her and touched everyone, 'It's all we do,'
we made love for the last time, I was with her and with everyone, when she got up to go
to the bathroom there was blood on the sheets, I went back to the guest room to sleep,
there are so many things you'll never know. The next morning I was awoken by a tapping
on the window, I told your mother I was going for a walk, she didn't ask anything, what
did she know, why did she let me out of her sight?
Oskar was waiting for me under the streetlamp, he said, 'I want to die up his grave.'
[Remaining text unreadable]
A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO AN IMPOSSIBLE PROBLEM
 The day after the renter and I dug up Dad's grave, I went to Mr. Black's apartment. I felt
like he deserved to know what happened, even if he wasn't actually a part of it. But when I
knocked, the person who answered wasn't him. 'Can I help you?' a woman asked. Her
glasses were hanging from a chain around her neck, and she was holding a folder with lots
of paper coming out of it. 'You're not Mr. Black.'
'Mr. Black?'
'Mr. Black who lives here. Where is he?'
'I'm sorry, I don't know.'
'Is he OK?'
'I assume so. I don't know.'
162
'Who are you?'
'I'm a realtor.'
'What's that?'
'I'm selling the apartment.'
'Why?'
'I suppose the owner wants to sell it. I'm just covering today.'
'Covering?'
'The realtor who represents this property is sick.'
'Do you know how I can find the owner?'
'I'm sorry, I don't.'
'He was my friend.'
She told me, 'They're coming by sometime this morning to take everything away.'
'Who's they?'
'They. I don't know. Contractors. Garbage men. They.'
'Not moving men?'
'I don't know.'
'They're throwing his things away?'
'Or selling them.' If I'd been incredibly rich, I would have bought everything, even if I just
had to put it in storage. I told her, 'Well, I left something in the apartment. It's something
of mine, so they can't sell it or give it away. I'm going to get it. Excuse me.'
I went to the index of biographies. I knew I couldn't save the whole thing, obviously, but
there was something I needed. I pulled out the B drawer and nipped through the cards. I
found Mr. Black's. I knew it was the right thing to do, so I took it out and put it in the
pouch of my overalls.
But then, even though I'd gotten what I wanted, I went to the S drawer. Antonin Scalia, G.
L. Scarborough, Lord Leslie George Scarman, Maurice Sceve, Anne Wilson Schaef, Jack
Warner Schaefer, Iris Scharmel, Robert Haven Schauffler, Barry Scheck, Johann Schemer,
Jean de SchelandreÃ¢Â€Â¦And then I saw it: Schell.
At first I was relieved, because I felt like everything I'd done had been worth it, because I'd
made Dad into a Great Man who was bio-graphically significant and would be remembered.
But then I examined the card, and I saw that it wasn't Dad.
OSKAR SCHELL: SON
I wish I had known that I wasn't going to see Mr. Black again when we shook hands that
afternoon. I wouldn't have let go. Or I would have forced him to keep searching with me.
Or I would have told him about how Dad called when I was home. But I didn't know, just
163
like I didn't know it was the last time Dad would ever tuck me in, because you never
know. So when he said, 'I'm finished. I hope you understand,' I said, 'I understand,' even
though I didn't understand. I never went to find him on the observation deck of the Empire
State Building, because I was happier believing he was there than finding out for sure.
I kept looking for the lock after he told me he was finished, but it wasn't the same.
I went to Far Rockaway and Boerum Hill and Long Island City.
I went to Dumbo and Spanish Harlem and the Meatpacking District.
I went to Flatbush and Tudor City and Little Italy.
I went to Bedford-Stuyvesant and Inwood and Red Hook.
I don't know if it was because Mr. Black wasn't with me anymore, or because I'd been
spending so much time making plans with the renter to dig up Dad's grave, or just because
I'd been looking for so long without finding anything, but I no longer felt like I was
moving in the direction of Dad. I'm not even sure I believed in the lock anymore.
The last Black I visited was Peter. He lived in Sugar Hill, which is in Hamilton Heights,
which is in Harlem. A man was sitting on the stoop when I walked up to the house. He
had a little baby on his knee, who he was talking to, even though babies don't understand
language, obviously. 'Are you Peter Black?'
'Who's asking?'
'Oskar Schell.' He patted the step, which meant I could sit next to him if I wanted, which I
thought was nice, but I wanted to stand. 'That's your baby?'
'Yes.'
'Can I pet her?'
'Him.'
'Can I pet him?'
'Sure,' he said. I couldn't believe how soft his head was, and how little his eyes were, and
his fingers. 'He's very vulnerable,' I said. 'He is,' Peter said, 'but we keep him pretty safe.'
'Does he eat normal food?'
'Not yet. Just milk for now.'
'Does he cry a lot?'
'I'd say so. Definitely feels like a lot.'
'But babies don't get sad, right? He's just hungry or something.'
'We'll never know.' I liked watching the baby make fists. I wondered if he could have
thoughts, or if he was more like a nonhuman animal. 'Do you want to hold him?'
'I don't think that's a very good idea.'
'Why not?'
'I don't know how to hold a baby.'
'If you want to, I'll show you. It's easy.'
'OK.'
164
'Why don't you sit down?' he said. 'Here you go. Now put one of your hands under here.
Like that. Good. Now put the other around his head. That's right. You can kind of hold it
against your chest. Right. Like that. You've got it. Just like that. He's as happy as can be.'
'This is good?'
'You're doing great.'
'What's his name?'
'Peter.'
'I thought that was your name.'
'We're both Peter.' It made me wonder for the first time why I wasn't named after Dad, although
I didn't wonder about the renter's name being Thomas. I said, 'Hi, Peter. I'll protect
you.'
When I got home that afternoon, after eight months of searching New York, I was exhausted
and frustrated and pessimistic, even though what I wanted to be was happy.
I went up to my laboratory, but I didn't feel like performing any experiments. I didn't feel
like playing the tambourine, or spoiling Buckminster, or arranging my collections, or looking
through Stuff That Happened to Me
.
Mom and Ron were hanging out in the family room, even though he wasn't part of our
family. I went to the kitchen to get some dehydrated ice cream. I looked over at the telephone.
The new phone. It looked back at me. Whenever it would ring, I'd scream, 'The
phone's ringing!' because I didn't want to touch it. I didn't even want to be in the same
room with it.
I pressed the Message Play button, which I hadn't done since the worst day, and that was
on the old phone.
Message one. Saturday, 11:52 A.M.
Hi, this is a message for Oskar Schell. Oskar, this is Abby Black. You were just over
at my apartment asking about the key. I wasn't completely honest with you, and I
think I might be able to help. Please give –
And then the message was cut off.
Abby was the second Black I had gone to, eight months before. She lived in the narrowest
house in New York. I told her she was pretty. She cracked up. I told her she was pretty.
She told me I was sweet. She cried when I told her about elephant E.S.P. I asked if we
could kiss. She didn't say she didn't want to. Her message had been waiting for me for
eight months.
'Mom?'
'Yes?'
'I'm going out.'
'OK.'
'I'll be back later.'
165
'OK.'
'I don't know when. It could be extremely late.'
'OK.' Why didn't she ask me more? Why didn't she try to stop me, or at least keep me safe?
Because it was starting to get dark, and because the streets were crowded, I bumped into a
googolplex people. Who were they? Where were they going? What were they looking for?
I wanted to hear their heartbeats, and I wanted them to hear mine.
The subway station was just a few blocks from her house, and when I got there the door
was open a little, like she knew I'd be coming, even though she couldn't have, obviously.
So why was it open?
'Hello? Is anyone there? It's Oskar Schell.'
She came to the door.
I was relieved, because I hadn't invented her.
'Do you remember me?'
'Of course I do, Oskar. You've grown.'
'I have?'
'A lot. Inches.'
'I've been so busy searching that I haven't been measuring myself.'
'Come in,' she said. 'I thought you weren't going to call me back. It's been a long time since
I left that message.' I told her, 'I'm afraid of the phone.'
She said, 'I've thought about you a lot.' I said, 'Your message.'
'From months ago?'
'How weren't you honest with me?'
'I told you I didn't know anything about the key.'
'But you did?'
'Yes. Well, no. I don't. My husband does.'
'Why didn't you tell me when we met?'
'I couldn't.'
'Why not?'
'I just couldn't.'
'That's not a real answer.'
'My husband and I had been having a terrible fight.'
'He was my dad!'
'He was my husband.'
'He was murdered!'
'I wanted to hurt him.'
'Why?'
'Because he had hurt me.'
166
'Why?'
'Because people hurt each other. That's what people do.'
'It's not what I do.'
'I know.'
'I spent eight months looking for what you could have told me in eight seconds!'
'I called you. Right after you left.'
'You hurt me!'
'I'm very sorry.'
'So
?' I asked. 'So what about your husband?' She said, 'He's been looking for you.'
'He's been looking for me
?'
'Yes.'
'But I've been looking for him
!'
'He'll explain everything to you. I think you should call him.'
'I'm angry at you because you weren't honest with me.'
'I know.'
'You almost ruined my life.'
We were incredibly close.
I could smell her breathing.
She said, 'If you want to kiss me, you can.'
'What?'
'You asked me, that day we met, if we could kiss. I said no then, but I am saying yes now.'
'I'm embarrassed about that day.'
'There's no reason to be embarrassed.'
'You don't have to let me kiss you just because you feel sorry for me.'
'Kiss me,' she said, 'and I'll kiss you back.' I asked her, 'What if we just hugged?'
She held me against her.
I started to cry, and I squeezed her as tightly as I could. Her shoulder was getting wet and
I thought, Maybe it's true that you can use up all of your tears. Maybe Grandma's right about
that
. It was nice to think about, because what I wanted was to be empty.
And then, out of nowhere, I had a revelation, and the floor disappeared from under me,
and I was standing on nothing.
I pulled away.
167
'Why did your message cut off?'
'Excuse me?'
'The message you left on our phone. It just stops in the middle.'
'Oh, that must have been when your mother picked up.'
'My mom picked up?'
'Yes.'
'And then what?'
'What do you mean?'
'Did you talk to her?'
'For a few minutes.'
'What did you tell her?'
'I don't remember.'
'But you told her that I'd gone to visit you?'
'Yes, of course. Was I wrong to?'
I didn't know if she was wrong to. And I didn't know why Mom hadn't said anything
about their conversation, or even about the message.
'The key? You told her about it?'
'I assumed she already knew.'
'And my mission?'
It didn't make any sense.
Why hadn't Mom said anything?
Or done anything?
Or cared at all?
And then, all of a sudden, it made perfect sense.
All of a sudden I understood why, when Mom asked where I was going, and I said 'Out,'
she didn't ask any more questions. She didn't have to, because she knew.
It made sense that Ada knew I lived on the Upper West Side, and that Carol had hot cookies
waiting when I knocked on her door, and that doorman215@hotmail.com said 'Good
luck, Oskar' when I left, even though I was ninety-nine-percent sure I hadn't told him that
my name was Oskar.
They knew I was coming.
Mom had talked to all of them before I had.
Even Mr. Black was part of it. He must have known I was going to knock on his door that
day, because she must have told him. She probably told him to go around with me, and
keep me company, and keep me safe. Did he even really like me? And were all of his
amazing stories even true? Were his hearing aids real? The bed that pulled? Were the bullets
and roses bullets and roses?
The whole time.
168
Everyone.
Everything.
Probably Grandma knew.
Probably even the renter.
Was the renter even the renter?
My search was a play that Mom had written, and she knew the ending when I was at the
beginning.
I asked Abby, 'Was your door open because you knew I was coming?' She didn't say anything
for a few seconds. Then she said, 'Yes.'
'Where's your husband?'
'He's not my husband.'
'I don't. Understand. ANYTHING!'
'He's my ex-husband.'
'Where is he?'
'He's at work.'
'But it's Sunday night.' She said, 'He does foreign markets.'
'What
?'
'It's Monday morning in Japan.'
'There's a young man here to see you,' the woman behind the desk said into the phone,
and it made me feel so weird to think that he was on the other end of the line, even if I
knew I was getting confused about who 'he' was. 'Yes,' she said, 'a very young man.' Then
she said, 'No.' Then she said, 'Oskar Schell.' Then she said, 'Yes. He says to see you.'
'May I ask what this concerns?' she asked me. 'He says his dad,' she said into the phone.
Then she said, 'That's what he says.' Then she said, 'OK.' Then she said to me, 'Go down
the hallway. His door is the third on the left.'
There was art that was probably famous on the walls. There were incredibly beautiful
views out of the windows, which Dad would have loved. But I didn't look at any of it, and
I didn't take any pictures. I'd never been so concentrated in my life, because I'd never been
closer to the lock. I knocked on the third door on the left, which had a sign on it that said
WILLIAM BLACK. A voice from inside the room said, 'Come in.'
'What can I do for you tonight?' said a man behind a desk. He was about the same age that
Dad would have been, or I guess still was, if dead people have ages. He had brownishgrayish
hair, a short beard, and round brown glasses. For a second he looked familiar, and
I wondered if he was the person I had seen from the Empire State Building through the
binocular machine. But then I realized that was impossible, because we were at Fiftyseventh
Street, which is north, obviously. There were a bunch of picture frames on his
desk. I looked at them quickly to make sure Dad wasn't in any of the pictures.
I asked, 'Did you know my dad?' He leaned back in his chair and said, 'I'm not sure. Who
169
was your dad?'
'Thomas Schell.' He thought for a minute. I hated how he had to think. 'No,' he said. 'I
don't know any Schells.'
'Knew.'
'Excuse me?'
'He's dead, so you couldn't know him now.'
'I'm sorry to hear that.'
'You must have known him, though.'
'No. I'm sure I didn't.'
'But you must
 have.'
I told him, 'I found a little envelope that had your name on it, and I thought maybe it was
your wife, who I know is now your ex-wife, but she said she didn't know what it was, and
your name is William, and I wasn't anywhere near the Ws yet – '
'My wife?'
'I went and talked to her.'
'Talked to her where?'
'The narrowest townhouse in New York.'
'How was she?'
'What do you mean?'
'How did she seem?'
'Sad.'
'Sad how?'
'Just sad.'
'What was she doing?'
'Nothing, really. She was trying to give me food, even though I told her I wasn't hungry.
Someone was in the other room while we talked.'
'A man?'
'Yeah.'
'You saw him?'
'He passed by the door, but mostly he was yelling from another room.'
'He was yelling
?'
'Extremely loud.'
'What was he yelling?'
'I couldn't hear the words.'
'Did he sound intimidating?'
170
'I don't know what that means.'
'Was he scary?'
'What about my dad?'
'When was this?'
'Eight months ago.'
'Eight months ago?'
'Seven months and twenty-eight days.' He smiled. 'Why are you smiling?' He put his face
in his hands, like he was going to cry, but he didn't. He looked up and said, 'That man was
me.'
'You?'
'Eight months ago. Yeah. I thought you were talking about the other day.'
'But he didn't have a beard.'
'He grew a beard.'
'And he didn't wear glasses.' He took off his glasses and said, 'He changed.' I started thinking
about the pixels in the image of the falling body, and how the closer you looked, the
less you could see. 'Why were you yelling?'
'Long story.'
'I have a long time,' I said, because anything that could bring me closer to Dad was something
I wanted to know about, even if it would hurt me. 'It's a long, long story.'
'Please.' He closed a notebook that was open on his desk and said, 'It's too long a story.'
I said, 'Don't you think it's so weird that we were in the apartment together eight months
ago and now we're in this office together?'
He nodded.
'It's weird,' I said. 'We were incredibly close.'
He said, 'So what's so special about the envelope?'
'Nothing, exactly. It's what was in
 the envelope.'
'Which was?'
'Which was this.' I pulled the string around my neck, and made it so the key to our apartment
was on my back and Dad's key rested on the pouch of my overalls, over Mr. Black's
biography, over the Band-Aid, over my heart. 'Can I see that?' he asked. I took it off of my
neck and handed it to him. He examined it and asked, 'Did it say something on the envelope?'

'It said 'Black.' He looked up at me. 'Did you find it in a blue vase?'
'Jose!'
He said, 'I can't believe it.'
'You can't believe what?'
'This is truly the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me.'
171
'What
 is?'
'I've spent two years trying to find this key.'
'But I've spent eight months trying to find the lock.'
'Then we've been looking for each other.' I was finally able to ask the most important question
of my life. 'What does it open?'
'It opens a safe-deposit box.'
'Well, what's it got to do with my dad?'
'Your dad?'
'The whole point
 of the key is that I found it in my dad's closet, and since he's dead, I couldn't ask him what
it meant, so I had to find out for myself.'
'You found it in his closet?'
'Yes.'
'In a tall blue vase?' I nodded. 'With a label on the bottom?'
'I don't know. I didn't see a label. I don't remember.' If I'd been alone, I would have given
myself the biggest bruise of my life. I would have turned myself into one big bruise.
'My father passed away about two years ago,' he said. 'He went in for a checkup and the
doctor told him he had two months to live. He died two months later.' I didn't want to
hear about death. It was all anyone talked about, even when no one was actually talking
about it. 'I needed to figure out what to do with all of his things. Books, furniture, clothes.'
'Didn't you want to keep them?'
'I didn't want any of it.' I thought that was weird, because Dad's things were all I wanted.
'So to make a long story short – '
'You don't have to make a long story short.'
'I had an estate sale. I shouldn't have been there. I should have hired someone to take care
of it. Or I should have given it all away. Instead I was in the position of telling people that
the prices for his belongings weren't negotiable. His wedding suit wasn't negotiable. His
sunglasses weren't negotiable. It was one of the worst days of my life. Maybe the worst.'
'Are you OK?'
'I'm fine. It's been a bad couple of years. My father and I weren't exactly close.'
'Do you need a hug?'
'I'll be OK.'
'Why not?'
'Why not what?'
'Why weren't you and your dad exactly close?' He said, 'Too long a story.'
'Can you please tell me about my dad now?'
'My father wrote letters when he found out about the cancer. He wasn't much of a letter
172
writer before. I don't know if he ever wrote. But he spent his last two months writing obsessively.
Whenever he was awake.' I asked why, but what I really wanted to know was
why I started writing letters after Dad died. 'He was trying to say his goodbyes. He wrote
to people he barely knew. If he hadn't already been sick, his letters would have been his
sickness. I had a business meeting the other day, and in the middle of our conversation the
man asked if I was related to Edmund Black. I told him yes, he was my father. He said, 'I
went to high school with your dad. He wrote me the most amazing letter before he died.
Ten pages. I only barely knew him. We hadn't talked in fifty years. It was the most amazing
letter I'd ever read.' I asked him if I could see it. He said, 'I don't think it was meant to
be shared.' I told him it would mean a lot to me. He said, 'He mentions you in it.' I told
him I understood.
'I looked through my father's Rolodex – '
'What's that?'
'Phone book. I called every name. His cousins, his business partners, people I'd never
heard of. He'd written to everyone. Every single person. Some let me see their letters. Others
didn't.'
'What were they like?'
'The shortest was a single sentence. The longest was a couple dozen pages. Some of them
were almost like little plays. Others were just questions to the person he was writing to.'
'What kinds of questions?'
'Did you know I was in love with you that summer in Norfolk?' 'Will they be taxed for
possessions I leave, like the piano?' 'How do light bulbs work?'
'I could have explained that to him.'
'Does anyone actually die in his sleep?'
'Some of his letters were funny. I mean, really, really funny. I didn't know he could be so
funny. And some were philosophical. He wrote about how happy he was, and how sad he
was, and all of the things he wanted to do but never did, and all of the things he did but
didn't want to do.'
'Didn't he write a letter to you?'
'Yes.'
'What did it say?'
'I couldn't read it. Not for a few weeks.'
'Why not?'
'It was too painful.'
'I would have been extremely curious.'
'My wife – my ex-wife – said I was being crazy not to read it.'
'That wasn't very understanding of her.'
'She was right, though. It was crazy. It was unreasonable. I was being childish.'
'Yeah, but you were his child.'
173
'But I was his child. That's right. I'm babbling. To make a long story short – '
'Don't make it short,' I said, because even though I wanted him to tell me about my dad
instead of his, I also wanted to make the story as long as I could, because I was afraid of its
end. He said, 'I read it. Maybe I was expecting something confessional. I don't know.
Something angry, or asking for forgiveness. Something that would make me rethink everything.
But it was matter-of-fact. More of a document than a letter, if that makes sense.'
'I guess so.'
'I don't know. Maybe I was wrong to, but I was expecting him to say he was sorry for
things, and tell me he loved me. End-of-life stuff. But there was none of it. He didn't even
say 'I love you.' He told me about his will, his life insurance policy, all of those horrible
businesslike things that feel so inappropriate to think about when someone has died.'
'You were disappointed?'
'I was angry.'
'I'm sorry.'
'No. There's nothing to be sorry for. I thought about it. I thought about it all the time. My
father told me where he'd left things, and what he wanted taken care of. He was responsible.
He was good. It's easy to be emotional. You can always make a scene. Remember me
eight months ago? That was easy.'
'It didn't sound easy.'
'It was simple. Highs and lows make you feel that things matter, but they're nothing.'
'So what's something?'
'Being reliable is something. Being good.'
'And what about the key?'
'At the end of his letter he wrote, 'I have something for you. In the blue vase, on the shelf
in the bedroom, is a key. It opens a safe-deposit box at our bank. I hope you'll understand
why I wanted you to have it.'
'And? What was in it?'
'I didn't read the note until after I'd sold all of his belongings. I had sold the vase. I sold it
to your father.'
'What the?
'
'That's why I've been trying to find you.'
'You met my dad?'
'Only briefly, but yes.'
'Do you remember him?'
'It was just a minute.'
'But do you remember him?'
'We chatted a bit.'
174
'And?'
'He was a nice man. I think he could see how hard it was for me to part with those things.'
'Could you please describe him?'
'Gosh, I don't really remember much.'
'Please
.'
'He was maybe five foot ten. He had brown hair. He wore glasses.'
'What kind of glasses?'
'Thick glasses.'
'What kind of clothes was he wearing?'
'A suit, I think.'
'What suit?'
'Gray, maybe?'
'That's true! He wore a gray suit to work! Did he have a gap between his teeth?'
'I don't remember.'
'Try.'
'He said he was on his way home and saw the sign for the sale. He told me that he had an
anniversary coming up the next week.'
'September 14!'
'He was going to surprise your mom. The vase was perfect, he said. He said she'd love it.'
'He was going to surprise her?'
'He'd made reservations at her favorite restaurant. It was going to be some sort of fancy
night out.'
The tuxedo
.
'What else did he say?'
'What else did he sayÃ¢Â€Â¦'
'Anything.'
'He had a great laugh. I remember that. It was good of him to laugh, and to make me
laugh. He was laughing for my sake.'
'What else?'
'He had a very discerning eye.'
'What's that?'
'He knew what he liked. He knew when he'd found it.'
'That's true. He had an incredibly discerning eye.'
'I remember watching him hold the vase. He examined the bottom of it and turned it
around a number of times. He seemed like a very thoughtful person.'
175
'He was extremely thoughtful.'
I wished he could remember even more details, like if Dad had unbuttoned his shirt's top
button, or if he smelled like shaving, or if he whistled 'I Am the Walrus.' Was he holding a
New York Times
 under his arm? Were his lips chapped? Was there a red pen in his pocket?
'When the apartment was empty that night, I sat on the floor and read the letter from my
father. I read about the vase. I felt like I'd failed him.'
'But couldn't you go to the bank and tell them you'd lost the key?'
'I tried that. But they said they didn't have a box under his name. I tried my name. No box.
Not under my mother's name or my grandparents' names. It didn't make any sense.'
'There was nothing the bank people could do?'
'They were sympathetic, but without the key, I was stuck.'
'And that's why you needed to find my dad.'
'I hoped he would realize that there was a key in the vase and find me. But how could he?
We sold my father's apartment, so even if he went back, it would be a dead end. And I was
sure he'd just throw the key away if he found it, assuming it was junk. That's what I would
have done. And there was no way I could find him. Absolutely no way. I knew nothing
about him, not even his name. For a few weeks I'd go over to the neighborhood on my
way home from work, even though it wasn't on my way. It was an hour out of my way. I'd
walk around looking for him. I put up a few signs when I realized what had happened: 'To
the man who bought the vase at the estate sale on Seventy-fifth Street this weekend, please
contactÃ¢Â€Â¦' But this was the week after September 11. There were posters everywhere.'

'My mom put up posters of him.'
'What do you mean?'
'He died in September 11. That's how he died.'
'Oh, God. I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.'
'It's OK.'
'I don't know what to say.'
'You don't have to say anything.'
'I didn't see the posters. If I hadÃ¢Â€Â¦Well, I don't know what if I had.'
'You would have been able to find us.'
'I guess that's right.'
'I wonder if your posters and my mom's posters were ever close to each other.'
He said, 'Wherever I was, I was trying to find him: uptown, downtown, on the train. I
looked in everyone's eyes, but none were his. Once I saw someone I thought might be your
father across Broadway in Times Square, but I lost him in the crowd. I saw someone I
thought might be him getting into a cab at Twenty-third Street. I would have called after
him, but I didn't know his name.'
176
'Thomas.'
'Thomas. I wish I'd known it then.'
He said, 'I followed one man around Central Park for more than half an hour. I thought he
was your father. I couldn't figure out why he was walking in such a strange, crisscrossing
way. He wasn't getting anywhere. I couldn't figure it out.'
'Why didn't you stop him?'
'Eventually I did.'
'And what happened?'
'I was wrong. It was someone else.'
'Did you ask him why he was walking like that?'
'He'd lost something and was searching the ground for it.'
'Well, you don't have to look anymore,' I told him. He said, 'I've spent so long looking for
this key. It's hard to look at it.'
'Don't you want to see what he left for you?'
'I don't think it's a question of wanting.' I asked him, 'What's it a question of?'
He said, 'I'm so sorry. I know that you're looking for something, too. And I know this isn't
what you're looking for.'
'It's OK.'
'For what it's worth, your father seemed like a good man. I only spoke with him for a few
minutes, but that was long enough to see that he was good. You were lucky to have a father
like that. I'd trade this key for that father.'
'You shouldn't have to choose.'
'No, you shouldn't.'
We sat there, not saying anything. I examined the pictures on his desk again. All of them
were of Abby.
He said, 'Why don't you come with me to the bank?'
'You're nice, but no thank you.'
'Are you sure?' It's not that I wasn't curious. I was incredibly curious. It's that I was afraid
of getting confused.
He said, 'What is it?'
'Nothing.'
'Are you all right?' I wanted to keep the tears in, but I couldn't. He said, 'I'm so, so sorry.'
'Can I tell you something that I've never told anyone else?'
'Of course.'
'On that day, they let us out of school basically as soon as we got there. They didn't really
tell us why, just that something bad had happened. We didn't get it, I guess. Or we didn't
get that something bad could happen to us. A lot of parents came to pick up their kids, but
since school is only five blocks from my apartment, I walked home. My friend told me he
177
was going to call, so I went to the answering machine and the light was beeping. There
were five messages. They were all from him.'
'Your friend?'
'My dad.'
He covered his mouth with his hand.
'He just kept saying that he was OK, and that everything would be fine, and that we
shouldn't worry.'
A tear went down his cheek and rested on his finger.
'But this is the thing that I've never told anyone. After I listened to the messages, the phone
rang. It was 10:22. I looked at the caller ID and saw that it was his cell phone.'
'Oh, God.'
'Could you please put your hand on me so I can finish the rest?'
'Of course,' he said, and he scooted his chair around his desk and next to me.
'I couldn't pick up the phone. I just couldn't do it. It rang and rang, and I couldn't move. I
wanted to pick it up, but I couldn't.
'The answering machine went on, and I heard my own voice.'
Hi, you've reached the Schell residence. Here is today's fact of the day: It's so cold in
Yukatia, which is in Siberia, that breath instantly freezes with a crackling noise that
they call the whispering of the stars. On extremely cold days, the towns are covered
in a fog caused by the breath of humans and animals. Please leave a message.
'There was a beep.
'Then I heard Dad's voice.'
Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?
'He needed me, and I couldn't pick up. I just couldn't pick up. I just couldn't. Are you there?
He asked eleven times. I know, because I've counted. It's one more than I can count on my
fingers. Why did he keep asking? Was he waiting for someone to come home? And why
didn't he say 'anyone'? Is anyone there
? 'You' is just one person. Sometimes I think he knew I was there. Maybe he kept saying it
to give me time to get brave enough to pick up. Also, there was so much space between
the times he asked. There are fifteen seconds between the third and the fourth, which is
the longest space. You can hear people in the background screaming and crying. And you
can hear glass breaking, which is part of what makes me wonder if people were jumping.
Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are
you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you
'And then it cut off.
'I've timed the message, and it's one minute and twenty-seven seconds. Which means it
ended at 10:24. Which was when the building came down. So maybe that's how he died.'
'I'm so sorry,' he said.
'I've never told that to anyone.'
178
He squeezed me, almost like a hug, and I could feel him shaking his head.
I asked him, 'Do you forgive me?'
'Do I forgive you?'
'Yeah.'
'For not being able to pick up?'
'For not being able to tell anyone.'
He said, 'I do.'
I took the string off my neck and put it around his neck.
'What about this other key?' he asked.
I told him, 'That's to our apartment.'
The renter was standing under the streetlamp when I got home. We met there every night
to talk about the details of our plan, like what time we should leave, and what we would
do if it was raining, or if a guard asked us what we were doing. We ran out of realistic details
in just a few meetings, but for some reason we still weren't ready to go. So we made
up unrealistic details to plan, like alternate driving routes in case the Fifty-ninth Street
Bridge collapsed, and ways to get over the cemetery fence in case it was electrified, and
how to outsmart the police if we were arrested. We had all sorts of maps and secret codes
and tools. We probably would have gone on making plans forever if I hadn't met William
Black that night, and learned what I'd learned.
The renter wrote, 'You're late.' I shrugged my shoulders, just like Dad used to. He wrote, 'I
got us a rope ladder, just in case.' I nodded. 'Where were you? I was worried.' I told him, 'I
found the lock.'
'You found it?' I nodded. 'And?'
I didn't know what to say. I found it and now I can stop looking? I found it and it had
nothing to do with Dad? I found it and now I'll wear heavy boots for the rest of my life?
'I wish I hadn't found it.'
'It wasn't what you were looking for?'
'That's not it.'
'Then what?'
'I found it and now I can't look for it.' I could tell he didn't understand me. 'Looking for it
let me stay close to him for a little while longer.'
'But won't you always be close to him?' I knew the truth. 'No.'
He nodded like he was thinking of something, or thinking about a lot of things, or thinking
about everything, if that's even possible. He wrote, 'Maybe it's time to do the thing
we've been planning.'
I opened my left hand, because I knew if I tried to say something I would just start crying
again.
We agreed to go on Thursday night, which was the second anniversary of Dad's death,
which seemed appropriate.
179
Before I walked into the building, he handed me a letter. 'What is this?' He wrote, 'Stan
went to get coffee. He told me to give this to you in case he didn't get back in time.'
'What is it?' He shrugged his shoulders and went across the street.
Dear Oskar Schell,
I've read every letter that you've sent me these past two years. In return, I've sent
you many form letters, with the hope of one day being able to give you the proper
response you deserve. But the more letters you wrote to me, and the more of yourself
you gave, the more daunting my task became.
I'm sitting beneath a pear tree as I dictate this to you, overlooking the orchards of a
friend's estate. I've spent the past few days here, recovering from some medical
treatment that has left me physically and emotionally depleted. As I moped about
this morning, feeling sorry for myself, it occurred to me, like a simple solution to an
impossible problem: today is the day I've been waiting for.
You asked me in your first letter if you could be my protégé. I don't know about
that, but I would be happy to have you join me in Cambridge for a few days. I
could introduce you to my colleagues, treat you to the best curry outside India, and
show you just how boring the life of an astrophysicist can be.
You can have a bright future in the sciences, Oskar. I would be happy to do anything
possible to facilitate such a path. It's wonderful to think what would happen
if you put your imagination toward scientific ends.
But Oskar, intelligent people write to me all the time. In your fifth letter you asked,
'What if I never stop inventing? ' That question has stuck with me.
I wish I were a poet. I've never confessed that to anyone, and I'm confessing it to
you, because you've given me reason to feel that I can trust you. I've spent my life
observing the universe, mostly in my mind's eye. It's been a tremendously rewarding
life, a wonderful life. I've been able to explore the origins of time and space with
some of the great living thinkers. But I wish I were a poet.
Albert Einstein, a hero of mine, once wrote, 'Our situation is the following. We are
standing in front of a closed box which we cannot open.'
I'm sure I don't have to tell you that the vast majority of the universe is composed of
dark matter. The fragile balance depends on things we'll never be able to see, hear,
smell, taste, or touch. Life itself depends on them. What's real? What isn't real?
Maybe those aren't the right questions to be asking. What does life depend on?
I wish I had made things for life to depend on.
What if you never stop inventing?
Maybe you're not inventing at all.
I'm being called in for breakfast, so I'll have to end this letter here. There's more I
want to tell you, and more I want to hear from you. It's a shame we live on different
continents. One shame of many.
It's so beautiful at this hour. The sun is low, the shadows are long, the air is cold
and clean. You won't be awake for another five hours, but I can't help feeling that
180
we 're sharing this clear and beautiful morning.
Your friend,
Stephen Hawking
MY FEELINGS
 A knocking woke me up in the middle of the night. I had been dreaming about where I
came from. I put on my robe and went to the door.
Who could it be? Why didn't the doorman ring up? A neighbor? But why?
More knocking. I looked through the peephole. It was your grandfather.
Come in. Where were you? Are you OK? The bottoms of his pants were covered in dirt.
Are you OK? He nodded.
Come in. Let me clean you off. What happened? He shrugged his shoulders. Did someone
hurt you? He showed me his right hand. Are you hurt?
We went to the kitchen table and sat down. Next to each other. The windows were black.
He put his hands on his knees. I slid closer to him until our sides touched. I put my head
on his shoulder. I wanted as much of us to touch as possible. I told him, You have to tell
me what happened for me to be able to help. He took a pen from his shirt pocket but there
was nothing to write on. I gave him my open hand. He wrote, I want to get you some
magazines.
In my dream, all of the collapsed ceilings reformed above us. The fire went back into the
bombs, which rose up and into the bellies of planes whose propellers turned backward,
like the second hands of the clocks across Dresden, only faster. I wanted to slap him with
his words.
I wanted to shout, It isn't fair, and bang my fists against the table like a child.
Anything special? he asked on my arm. Everything special, I said. Art magazines? Yes.
Nature magazines? Yes.
Politics? Yes.
Celebrities? Yes.
I told him to bring a suitcase so he could come back with one of everything.
I wanted him to be able to take his things with him. In my dream, spring came after summer,
came after fall, came after winter, came after spring.
I made him breakfast. I tried to make it delicious. I wanted him to have good memories, so
that maybe he would come back again one day. Or at least miss me.
181
I wiped the rim of the plate before I gave it to him. I spread his napkin on his lap. He didn't
say anything. When the time came, I went downstairs with him. There was nothing to
write on, so he wrote on me. I might not be back until late. I told him I understood. He
wrote, I'm going to get you magazines. I told him, I don't want any magazines. Maybe not
now, but you'll be grateful to have them. My eyes are crummy. Your eyes are perfect.
Promise me that you'll take care.
He wrote, I'm only going to get magazines.
Don't cry, I said, by putting my fingers on my face and pushing imaginary tears up my
cheeks and back into my eyes. I was angry because they were my tears. I told him, You're
only getting magazines. He showed me his left hand.
I tried to notice everything, because I wanted to be able to remember it perfectly. I've forgotten
everything important in my life. I can't remember what the front door of the house I
grew up in looked like. Or who stopped kissing first, me or my sister. Or the view from
any window but my own. Some nights I lay awake for hours trying to remember my
mother's face. He turned around and walked away from me.
I went back up to the apartment and sat on the sofa waiting. Waiting for what?
I can't remember the last thing my father said to me. He was trapped under the ceiling.
The plaster that covered him was turning red.
He said, I can't feel everything.
I didn't know if he'd meant to say he couldn't feel anything. He asked, Where is Mommy?
I didn't know if he was talking about my mother or his. I tried to pull the ceiling off him.
He said, Can you find my glasses for me?
I told him I would look for them. But everything had been buried. I had never seen my father
cry before. He said, With my glasses I could be helpful. I told him, Let me try to free
you. He said, Find my glasses.
They were shouting for everyone to get out. The rest of the ceiling was about to collapse. I
wanted to stay with him. But I knew he would want me to leave him. I told him, Daddy, I
have to leave you. Then he said something.
It was the last thing he ever said to me. I can't remember it.
In my dream, the tears went up his cheeks and back into his eyes. I got up off the sofa and
filled a suitcase with the typewriter and as much paper as would fit.
I wrote a note and taped it to the window. I didn't know whom it was for.
I went from room to room turning off the lights. I made sure none of the faucets were
dripping. I turned off the heat and unplugged the appliances. I closed all the windows.
As the cab drove me away, I saw the note. But I couldn't read it because my eyes are
crummy.
In my dream, painters separated green into yellow and blue. Brown into the rainbow.
Children pulled color from coloring books with crayons, and mothers who had lost children
mended their black clothing with scissors. I think about all of the things I've done,
Oskar. And all of the things I didn't do. The mistakes I've made are dead to me. But I can't
182
take back the things I never did.
I found him in the international terminal. He was sitting at a table with his hands on his
knees. I watched him all morning.
He asked people what time it was, and each person pointed at the clock on the wall.
I have been an expert at watching him. It's been my life's work. From my bedroom window.
From behind trees. From across the kitchen table. I wanted to be with him. Or anyone.

I don't know if I've ever loved your grandfather. But I've loved not being alone. I got very
close to him. I wanted to shout myself into his ear. I touched his shoulder. He lowered his
head.
How could you?
He wouldn't show me his eyes. I hate silence.
Say something.
He took his pen from his shirt pocket and the top napkin from the stack on the table.
He wrote, You were happy when I was away.
How could you think that?
We are lying to ourselves and to each other.
Lying about what? I don't care if we're lying.
I am a bad person.
I don't care. I don't care what you are.
I can't.
What's killing you?
He took another napkin from the stack.
He wrote, You're killing me.
And then I was silent.
He wrote, You remind me.
I put my hands on the table and told him, You have me.
He took another napkin and wrote, Anna was pregnant.
I told him, I know. She told me.
You know?
I didn't think you knew. She said it was a secret. I'm glad you know.
He wrote, I'm sorry I know.
It's better to lose than never to have had.
I lost something I never had.
You had everything.
When did she tell you?
We were in bed talking.
183
He pointed at, When.
Near the end.
What did she say?
She said, I'm going to have a baby.
Was she happy?
She was overjoyed.
Why didn't you say anything?
Why didn't you?
In my dream, people apologized for things that were about to happen, and lit candles by
inhaling.
I have been seeing Oskar, he wrote.
I know.
You know?
Of course I know.
He flipped back to, Why didn't you say anything?
Why didn't you?
The alphabet went z, y, x, wÃ¢Â€Â¦
The clocks went tock-tick, tock-tickÃ¢Â€Â¦
He wrote, I was with him last night. That's where I was. I buried the letters.
What letters?
The letters I never sent.
Buried them where?
In the ground. That's where I was. I buried the key, too.
What key?
To your apartment.
Our apartment.
He put his hands on the table.
Lovers pulled up each other's underwear, buttoned each other's shirts, and dressed and
dressed and dressed.
I told him, Say it.
When I saw Anna for the last time.
Say it.
When we.
Say it!
He put his hands on his knees.
I wanted to hit him.
184
I wanted to hold him.
I wanted to shout myself into his ear.
I asked, So what happens now?
I don't know.
Do you want to go home?
He flipped back to, I can't. Then you'll go away? He pointed at, I can't. Then we are out of
options. We sat there.
Things were happening around us, but nothing was happening between us.
Above us, the screens said which flights were landing and which were taking off. Madrid
departing. Rio arriving. Stockholm departing. Paris departing. Milan arriving.
Everyone was coming or going.
People around the world were moving from one place to another. No one was staying. I
said, What if we stay? Stay?
Here. What if we stay here at the airport? He wrote, Is that another joke? I shook my head
no. How could we stay here?
I told him, There are pay phones, so I could call Oskar and let him know I'm OK. And
there are paper stores where you could buy daybooks and pens. There are places to eat.
And money machines. And bathrooms. Even televisions. Not coming or going. Not something
or nothing. Not yes or no.
My dream went all the way back to the beginning. The rain rose into the clouds, and the
animals descended the ramp. Two by two. Two giraffes. Two spiders. Two goats.
Two lions. Two mice. Two monkeys. Two snakes. Two elephants.
The rain came after the rainbow.
As I type this, we are sitting across from each other at a table. It's not big, but it's big
enough for the two of us. He has a cup of coffee and I am drinking tea.
When the pages are in the typewriter, I can't see his face. In that way I am choosing you
over him. I don't need to see him. I don't need to know if he is looking up at me. It's not
even that I trust him not to leave. I know this won't last. I'd rather be me than him. The
words are coming so easily. The pages are coming easily.
At the end of my dream, Eve put the apple back on the branch. The tree went back into the
ground. It became a sapling, which became a seed.
God brought together the land and the water, the sky and the water, the water and the water,
evening and morning, something and nothing. He said, Let there be light. And there
was darkness. Oskar.
The night before I lost everything was like any other night. Anna and I kept each other
awake very late. We laughed. Young sisters in a bed under the roof of their childhood
home. Wind on the window.
How could anything less deserve to be destroyed? I thought we would be awake all night.
Awake for the rest of our lives. The spaces between our words grew.
185
It became difficult to tell when we were talking and when we were silent. The hairs of our
arms touched.
It was late, and we were tired.
We assumed there would be other nights.
Anna's breathing started to slow, but I still wanted to talk.
She rolled onto her side.
I said, I want to tell you something.
She said, You can tell me tomorrow.
I had never told her how much I loved her.
She was my sister.
We slept in the same bed.
There was never a right time to say it.
It was always unnecessary.
The books in my father's shed were sighing.
The sheets were rising and falling around me with Anna's breathing.
I thought about waking her.
But it was unnecessary.
There would be other nights.
And how can you say I love you to someone you love?
I rolled onto my side and fell asleep next to her.
Here is the point of everything I have been trying to tell you, Oskar.
It's always necessary.
I love you,
Grandma
BEAUTIFUL AND TRUE
 Mom made spaghetti for dinner that night. Ron ate with us. I asked him if he was still interested
in buying me a five-piece drum set with Zildjian cymbals. He said, 'Yeah. I think
that would be great.'
'How about a double bass pedal?'
'I don't know what that is, but I bet we could arrange it.' I asked him why he didn't have
186
his own family. Mom said, 'Oskar!' I said, 'What
?' Ron put down his knife and fork and said, 'It's OK.' He said, 'I did have a family, Oskar.
I had a wife and a daughter.'
'Did you get divorced?' He laughed and said, 'No.'
'Then where are they?' Mom looked at her plate. Ron said, 'They were in an accident.'
'What kind of accident?'
'A car accident.'
'I didn't know that.'
'Your mom and I met in a group for people that have lost family. That's where we became
friends.' I didn't look at Mom, and she didn't look at me. Why hadn't she told me she was
in a group?
'How come you didn't die in the accident?' Mom said, 'That's enough, Oskar.' Ron said, 'I
wasn't in the car.'
'Why weren't you in the car?' Mom looked out the window. Ron ran his finger around his
plate and said, 'I don't know.'
'What's weird,' I said, 'is that I've never seen you cry.' He said, 'I cry all the time.'
My backpack was already packed, and I'd already gotten the other supplies together, like
the altimeter and granola bars and the Swiss Army knife I'd dug up in Central Park, so
there was nothing else to do. Mom tucked me in at 9:36.
'Do you want me to read to you?'
'No thanks.'
'Is there anything you want to talk about?' If she wasn't going to say anything, I wasn't going
to say anything, so I shook my head no. 'I could make up a story?'
'No thank you.'
'Or look for mistakes in the Times?'
'Thanks, Mom, but not really.'
'That was nice of Ron to tell you about his family.'
'I guess so.'
'Try to be nice to him. He's been such a good friend, and he needs help, too.'
'I'm tired.'
I set my alarm for 11:50 P.M., even though I knew I wouldn't sleep.
While I lay there in bed, waiting for the time to come, I did a lot of inventing.
I invented a biodegradable car.
I invented a book that listed every word in every language. It wouldn't be a very useful
book, but you could hold it and know that everything you could possibly say was in your
hands.
What about a googolplex telephones?
What about safety nets everywhere?
187
At 11:50 P.M., I got up extremely quietly, took my things from under the bed, and opened
the door one millimeter at a time, so it wouldn't make any noise. Bart, the night doorman,
was asleep at the desk, which was lucky, because it meant I didn't have to tell any more
lies. The renter was waiting for me under the streetlamp. We shook hands, which was
weird. At exactly 12:00, Gerald pulled up in the limousine. He opened the door for us, and
I told him, 'I knew you'd be on time.' He patted me on the back and said, 'I wouldn't be
late.' It was my second time in a limousine ever.
As we drove, I imagined we were standing still and the world was coming toward us. The
renter sat all the way on his side, not doing anything, and I saw the Trump Tower, which
Dad thought was the ugliest building in America, and the United Nations, which Dad
thought was incredibly beautiful. I rolled down the window and stuck my arm out. I
curved my hand like an airplane wing. If my hand had been big enough, I could've made
the limousine fly. What about enormous gloves?
Gerald smiled at me in the rearview mirror and asked if we wanted any music. I asked
him if he had any kids. He said he had two daughters. 'What do they like?'
'What do they like?'
'Yeah.'
'Lemme see. Kelly, my baby, likes Barbie and puppies and bead bracelets.'
'I'll make her a bead bracelet.'
'I'm sure she'd like that.'
'What else?'
'If it's soft and pink, she likes it.'
'I like soft and pink things, too.' He said, 'Well, all right.'
'And what about your other daughter?'
'Janet? She likes sports. Her favorite is basketball, and I'll tell you, she can play. I don't
mean for a girl, either. I mean she's good.'
'Are they both special?' He cracked up and said, 'Of course their pop is gonna say they're
special.'
'But objectively.'
'What's that?'
'Like, factually. Truthfully.'
'The truth is I'm their pop.'
I stared out the window some more. We went over the part of the bridge that wasn't in
any borough, and I turned around and watched the buildings get smaller. I figured out
which button opened the sunroof, and I stood up with the top half of my body sticking out
of the car. I took pictures of the stars with Grandpa's camera, and in my head I connected
them to make words, whatever words I wanted. Whenever we were about to go under a
bridge or into a tunnel, Gerald told me to get back into the car so I wouldn't be decapitated,
which I know about but really, really
 wish I didn't. In my brain I made 'shoe' and 'inertia' and 'invincible.'
188
It was 12:56 A.M. when Gerald drove up onto the grass and pulled the limousine right
next to the cemetery. I put on my backpack, and the renter got the shovel, and we climbed
onto the roof of the limousine so we could get over the fence.
Gerald whispered, 'You sure you want to do this?'
Through the fence I told him, 'It probably won't take more than twenty minutes. Maybe
thirty.' He tossed over the renter's suitcases and said, 'I'll be here.'
Because it was so dark, we had to follow the beam of my flashlight.
I pointed it at a lot of tombstones, looking for Dad's.

I kept thinking about how they were all the names of dead people, and how names are basically
the only thing that dead people keep.
It was 1:22 when we found Dad's grave.
The renter offered me the shovel.
I said, 'You go first.'
He put it in my hand.
I pushed it into the dirt and stepped all of my weight onto it. I didn't even know how
many pounds I was, because I'd been so busy trying to find Dad.
It was extremely hard work, and I was only strong enough to remove a little bit of dirt at a
time. My arms got incredibly tired, but that was OK, because since we only had one
shovel, we took turns.
The twenty minutes passed, and then another twenty minutes.
We kept digging, but we weren't getting anywhere.
Another twenty minutes passed.
Then the batteries in the flashlight ran out, and we couldn't see our hands in front of us.
That wasn't part of our plan, and neither were replacement batteries, even though they
obviously should have been. How could I have forgotten something so simple and important?

I called Gerald's cell phone and asked if he could go pick up some D batteries for us. He
asked if everything was all right. It was so dark that it was even hard to hear. I said, 'Yeah,
we're OK, we just need some D batteries.' He said the only store he remembered was
189
about fifteen minutes away. I told him, 'I'll pay you extra.' He said, 'It's not about paying
me extra.'
Fortunately, because what we were doing was digging up Dad's grave, we didn't need to
see our hands in front of us. We only had to feel the shovel moving the dirt.
So we shoveled in the darkness and silence.
I thought about everything underground, like worms, and roots, and clay, and buried
treasure.
We shoveled.
I wondered how many things had died since the first thing was born. A trillion? A googolplex?

We shoveled.
I wondered what the renter was thinking about.
After a while, my phone played 'The Flight of the Bumblebee,' so I looked at the caller ID.
'Gerald.'
'Got 'em.'
'Can you bring them to us so we don't have to waste time going back to the limousine?' He
didn't say anything for a few seconds. 'I guess I could do that.' I couldn't describe where
we were to him, so I just kept calling his name, and he found my voice.
It felt much better to be able to see. Gerald said, 'Doesn't look like you two have gotten
very far.' I told him, 'We're not good shovelers.' He put his driving gloves in his jacket
pocket, kissed the cross that he wore around his neck, and took the shovel from me. Because
he was so strong, he could move a lot of dirt quickly.
It was 2:56 when the shovel touched the coffin. We all heard the sound and looked at each
other.
I told Gerald thanks.
He winked at me, then started walking back to the car, and then he disappeared in the
darkness. 'Oh yeah,' I heard him say, even though I couldn't find him with my flashlight,
'Janet, the older one, she loves cereal. She'd eat it three meals a day if we let her.'
I told him, 'I love cereal, too.'
He said, 'All right,' and his footsteps got quieter and quieter.
I lowered myself into the hole and used my paintbrush to wipe away the dirt that was left.
One thing that surprised me was that the coffin was wet. I guess I wasn't expecting that,
because how could so much water get underground?
Another thing that surprised me was that the coffin was cracked in a few places, probably
from the weight of all that dirt. If Dad had been in there, ants and worms could have gotten
in through the cracks and eaten him, or at least microscopic bacteria could have. I
knew it shouldn't matter, because once you're dead, you don't feel anything. So why did it
feel like it mattered?
Another thing that surprised me was how the coffin wasn't locked or even nailed shut.
The lid just rested on top of it, so that anyone who wanted to could open it up. That didn't
190
seem right. But on the other hand, who would want to open a coffin?
I opened the coffin.
I was surprised again, although again I shouldn't have been. I was surprised that Dad
wasn't there. In my brain I knew he wouldn't be, obviously, but I guess my heart believed
something else. Or maybe I was surprised by how incredibly empty it was. I felt like I was
looking into the dictionary definition of emptiness.
I'd had the idea to dig up Dad's coffin the night after I met the renter. I was lying in bed
and I had the revelation, like a simple solution to an impossible problem. The next morning
I threw pebbles at the guest room window, like he wrote for me to in his note, but I'm
not very accurate at throwing, so I had Walt do it. When the renter met me at the corner I
told him my idea.
He wrote, 'Why would you want to do that?' I told him, 'Because it's the truth, and Dad
loved the truth.'
'What truth?'
'That he's dead.'
After that, we met every afternoon and discussed the details, like we were planning a war.
We talked about how we would get to the cemetery, and different ways of climbing
fences, and where we would find a shovel, and all of the other necessary instruments, like
a flashlight and wire cutters and juice boxes. We planned and planned, but for some reason
we never talked about what we would actually do once we'd opened the coffin.
It wasn't until the day before we were going to go that the renter asked the obvious question.

I told him, 'We'll fill it, obviously.'
He asked another obvious question.
At first I suggested filling the coffin with things from Dad's life, like his red pens or his
jeweler's magnifying glass, which is called a loupe, or even his tuxedo. I guess I got that
idea from the Blacks who made museums of each other. But the more we discussed it, the
less sense it made, because what good would that do, anyway? Dad wouldn't be able to
use them, because he was dead, and the renter also pointed out that it would probably be
nice to have things of his around.
'I could fill the coffin with jewelry, like they used to do with famous Egyptians, which I
know about.'
'But he wasn't Egyptian.'
'And he didn't like jewelry.'
'He didn't like jewelry?'
'Maybe I could bury things I'm ashamed of,' I suggested, and in my head I was thinking of
the old telephone, and the sheet of stamps of Great American Inventors that I got mad at
Grandma about, and the script of Hamlet
, and the letters I had received from strangers, and the stupid card I'd made for myself,
and my tambourine, and the unfinished scarf. But that didn't make any sense either, be-
191
cause the renter reminded me that just because you bury something, you don't really bury
it. 'Then what?' I asked.
'I have an idea,' he wrote. 'I'll show you tomorrow.'
Why did I trust him so much?
The next night, when I met him on the corner at 1150, he had two suitcases. I didn't ask
him what was in them, because for some reason I thought I should wait until he told me,
even though he was my dad, which made the coffin mine, too.
Three hours later, when I climbed into the hole, brushed away the dirt, and opened the lid,
the renter opened the suitcases. They were filled with papers. I asked him what they were.
He wrote, 'I lost a son.'
'You did?' He showed me his left palm. 'How did he die?'
'I lost him before he died.'
'How?'
'I went away.'
'Why?' He wrote, 'I was afraid.'
'Afraid of what?'
'Afraid of losing him.'
'Were you afraid of him dying?'
'I was afraid of him living.'
'Why?' He wrote, 'Life is scarier than death.'
'So what's all that paper?'
He wrote, 'Things I wasn't able to tell him. Letters.'
To be honest, I don't know what I understood then.
I don't think I figured out that he was my grandpa, not even in the deep parts of my brain.
I definitely didn't make the connection between the letters in his suitcases and the envelopes
in Grandma's dresser, even if I should have.
But I must have understood something, I must have, because why else would I have
opened my left hand?
When I got home it was 4:22 A.M. Mom was on the sofa by the door. I thought she would
be incredibly angry at me, but she didn't say anything. She just kissed my head.
'Don't you want to know where I was?' She said, 'I trust you.'
'But aren't you curious?' She said, 'I assume you'd tell me if you wanted me to know.'
'Are you going to tuck me in?'
'I thought I'd stay here for a little while longer.'
'Are you mad at me?' She shook her head no. 'Is Ron mad at me?'
'No.'
'Are you sure?'
'Yes.'
192
I went to my room.
My hands were dirty, but I didn't wash them. I wanted them to stay dirty, at least until the
next morning. I hoped some of the dirt would stay under my fingernails for a long time,
and maybe some of the microscopic material would be there forever.
I turned off the lights.
I put my backpack on the floor, took off my clothes, and got into bed.
I stared at the fake stars.
What about windmills on the roof of every skyscraper?
What about a kite-string bracelet?
A fishing-line bracelet?
What if skyscrapers had roots?
What if you had to water skyscrapers, and play classical music to them, and know if they
like sun or shade?
What about a teakettle?
I got out of bed and ran to the door in my undies.
Mom was still on the sofa. She wasn't reading, or listening to music, or doing anything.
She said, 'You're awake.'
I started crying.
She opened her arms and said, 'What is it?'
I ran to her and said, 'I don't want to be hospitalized.'
She pulled me into her so my head was against the soft part of her shoulder, and she
squeezed me. 'You're not going to be hospitalized.'
I told her, 'I promise I'm going to be better soon.'
She said, 'There's nothing wrong with you.'
'I'll be happy and normal.'
She put her fingers around the back of my neck.
I told her, 'I tried incredibly hard. I don't know how I could have tried harder.'
She said, 'Dad would have been very proud of you.'
'Do you think so?'
'I know so.'
I cried some more. I wanted to tell her all of the lies that I'd told her. And then I wanted
her to tell me that it was OK, because sometimes you have to do something bad to do
something good. And then I wanted to tell her about the phone. And then I wanted her to
tell me that Dad still would have been proud of me.
She said, 'Dad called me from the building that day.'
I pulled away from her.
'What?'
193
'He called from the building.'
'On your cell phone?'
She nodded yes, and it was the first time since Dad died that I'd seen her not try to stop
her tears. Was she relieved? Was she depressed? Grateful? Exhausted?
'What did he say?'
'He told me he was on the street, that he'd gotten out of the building. He said he was walking
home.'
'But he wasn't.'
'No.'
Was I angry? Was I glad?
'He made it up so you wouldn't worry.'
'That's right.'
Frustrated? Panicky? Optimistic?
'But he knew you knew.'
'He did.'
I put my fingers around her neck, where her hair started.
I don't know how late it got.
I probably fell asleep, but I don't remember. I cried so much that everything blurred into
everything else. At some point she was carrying me to my room. Then I was in bed. She
was looking over me. I don't believe in God, but I believe that things are extremely complicated,
and her looking over me was as complicated as anything ever could be. But it
was also incredibly simple. In my only life, she was my mom, and I was her son.
I told her, 'It's OK if you fall in love again.'
She said, 'I won't fall in love again.'
I told her, 'I want you to.'
She kissed me and said, 'I'll never fall in love again.'
I told her, 'You don't have to make it up so I won't worry.'
She said, 'I love you.'
I rolled onto my side and listened to her walk back to the sofa.
I heard her crying. I imagined her wet sleeves. Her tired eyes.
One minute fifty-one seconds,
 Four minutes thirty-eight seconds,
 Seven minutes,
 I felt in the space between the bed and the wall, and found Stuff That Happened to Me
. It was completely full. I was going to have to start a new volume soon. I read that it was
the paper that kept the towers burning. All of those notepads, and Xeroxes, and printed emails,
and photographs of kids, and books, and dollar bills in wallets, and documents in
files, all of them were fuel. Maybe if we lived in a paperless society, which lots of scientists
194
say we'll probably live in one day soon, Dad would still be alive. Maybe I shouldn't start a
new volume.
I grabbed the flashlight from my backpack and aimed it at the book. I saw maps and drawings,
pictures from magazines and newspapers and the Internet, pictures I'd taken with
Grandpa's camera. The whole world was in there. Finally, I found the pictures of the falling
body.
Was it Dad?
Maybe.
Whoever it was, it was somebody.
I ripped the pages out of the book.
I reversed the order, so the last one was first, and the first was last.
When I flipped through them, it looked like the man was floating up through the sky.
And if I'd had more pictures, he would've flown through a window, back into the building,
and the smoke would've poured into the hole that the plane was about to come out of.
Dad would've left his messages backward, until the machine was empty, and the plane
would've flown backward away from him, all the way to Boston.
He would've taken the elevator to the street and pressed the button for the top floor.
He would've walked backward to the subway, and the subway would've gone backward
through the tunnel, back to our stop.
Dad would've gone backward through the turnstile, then swiped his Metrocard backward,
then walked home backward as he read the New York Times
 from right to left.
He would've spit coffee into his mug, unbrushed his teeth, and put hair on his face with a
razor.
He would've gotten back into bed, the alarm would've rung backward, he would've
dreamt backward.
Then he would've gotten up again at the end of the night before the worst day.
He would've walked backward to my room, whistling 'I Am the Walrus' backward.
He would've gotten into bed with me.
We would've looked at the stars on my ceiling, which would've pulled back their light
from our eyes.
I'd have said 'Nothing' backward.
He'd have said 'Yeah, buddy?' backward.
I'd have said 'Dad?' backward, which would have sounded the same as 'Dad' forward.
He would have told me the story of the Sixth Borough, from the voice in the can at the end
to the beginning, from 'I love you' to 'Once upon a time'
We would have been safe.
THE END

Looking for Alaska

one hundred
thirty-six days
before
The week before I left my family and
Florida and the rest of my minor life to
go to boarding school in Alabama, my
mother insisted on throwing me a goingaway
party. To say that I had low
expectations would be to underestimate
the matter dramatically. Although I was
more or less forced to invite all my
"school friends," i.e., the ragtag bunch of
drama people and English geeks I sat
with by social necessity in the cavernous
cafeteria of my public school, I knew
they wouldn't come. Still, my mother
persevered, awash in the delusion that I
had kept my popularity secret from her
all these years. She cooked a small
mountain of artichoke dip. She festooned
our living room in green and yellow
streamers, the colors of my new school.
She bought two dozen champagne
poppers and placed them around the
edge of our coffee table.
And when that final Friday came,
when my packing was mostly done, she
sat with my dad and me on the livingroom
couch at 4:56 p.m. and patiently
awaited the arrival of the Good-bye to
Miles Cavalry. Said cavalry consisted
of exactly two people: Marie Lawson, a
tiny blonde with rectangular glasses, and
her chunky (to put it charitably)
boyfriend, Will.
"Hey, Miles," Marie said as she sat
down.
"Hey," I said.
"How was your summer?" Will
asked.
"Okay. Yours?"
"Good. We did Jesus Christ
Superstar. I helped with the sets. Marie
did lights," said Will.
"That's cool." I nodded knowingly,
and that about exhausted our
conversational topics. I might have
asked a question about Jesus Christ
Superstar, except that 1 . I didn't know
what it was, and 2. I didn't care to learn,
and 3 . I never really excelled at small
talk. My mom, however, can talk small
for hours, and so she extended the
awkwardness by asking them about their
rehearsal schedule, and how the show
had gone, and whether it was a success.
"I guess it was," Marie said. "A lot
of people came, I guess." Marie was the
sort of person to guess a lot.
Finally, Will said, "Well, we just
dropped by to say good-bye. I've got to
get Marie home by six. Have fun at
boarding school, Miles."
"Thanks," I answered, relieved. The
only thing worse than having a party that
no one attends is having a party attended
only by two vastly, deeply uninteresting
people.
They left, and so I sat with my
parents and stared at the blank TV and
wanted to turn it on but knew I shouldn't.
I could feel them both looking at me,
waiting for me to burst into tears or
something, as if I hadn't known all along
that it would go precisely like this. But I
had known. I could feel their pity as they
scooped artichoke dip with chips
intended for my imaginary friends, but
they needed pity more than I did: I
wasn't disappointed. My expectations
had been met.
"Is this why you want to leave,
Miles?" Mom asked.
I mulled it over for a moment,
careful not to look at her. "Uh, no," I
said.
"Well, why then?" she asked. This
was not the first time she had posed the
question. Mom was not particularly keen
on letting me go to boarding school and
had made no secret of it.
"Because of me?" my dad asked. He
had attended Culver Creek, the same
boarding school to which I was headed,
as had both of his brothers and all of
their kids. I think he liked the idea of me
following in his footsteps. My uncles
had told me stories about how famous
my dad had been on campus for having
simultaneously raised hell and aced all
his classes. That sounded like a better
life than the one I had in Florida. But no,
it wasn't because of Dad. Not exactly.
"Hold on," I said. I went into Dad's
study and found his biography of
Frangois Rabelais. I liked reading
biographies of writers, even if (as was
the case with Monsieur Rabelais) I'd
never read any of their actual writing.
I flipped to the back and found the
highlighted quote ("NEVER USE A
HIGHLIGHTER IN MY BOOKS," my
dad had told me a thousand times. But
how else are you supposed to find what
you're looking for?).
"So this guy," I said, standing in the
doorway of the living room.
"Francois Rabelais. He was this
poet. And his last words were 'I go to
seek a Great Perhaps.' That's why I'm
going. So I don't have to wait until I die
to start seeking a Great Perhaps."
And that quieted them. I was after a
Great Perhaps, and they knew as well as
I did that I wasn't going to find it with
the likes of Will and Marie. I sat back
down on the couch, between my mom
and my dad, and my dad put his arm
around me, and we stayed there like that,
quiet on the couch together, for a long
time, until it seemed okay to turn on the
TV, and then we ate artichoke dip for
dinner and watched the History Channel,
and as going-away parties go, it
certainly could have been worse.
one hundred
twenty-eight days
before
Florida was plenty hot,certainly, and
humid, too. Hot enough that your clothes
stuck to you like Scotch tape, and sweat
dripped like tears from your forehead
into your eyes. But it was only hot
outside, and generally I only went
outside to walk from one air-conditioned
location to another.
This did not prepare me for the
unique sort of heat that one encounters
fifteen miles south of Birmingham,
Alabama, at Culver Creek Preparatory
School. My parents' SUV was parked in
the grass just a few feet outside my dorm
room, Room 43. But each time I took
those few steps to and from the car to
unload what now seemed like far too
much stuff, the sun burned through my
clothes and into my skin with a vicious
ferocity that made me genuinely fear
hellfire.
Between Mom and Dad and me, it
only took a few minutes to unload the
car, but my unair-conditioned dorm
room, although blessedly out of the
sunshine, was only modestly cooler. The
room surprised me: I'd pictured plush
carpet, wood-paneled walls, Victorian
furniture. Aside from one luxury — a
private bathroom — I got a box.
With cinder-block walls coated thick
with layers of white paint and a greenand-white-checkered
linoleum floor, the
place looked more like a hospital than
the dorm room of my fantasies. A bunk
bed of unfinished wood with vinyl
mattresses was pushed against the
room's back window. The desks and
dressers and bookshelves were all
attached to the walls in order to prevent
creative floor planning. And no airconditioning.
I sat on the lower bunk while Mom
opened the trunk, grabbed a stack of the
biographies my dad had agreed to part
with, and placed them on the
bookshelves.
"I can unpack, Mom," I said. My dad
stood. He was ready to go.
"Let me at least make your bed,"
Mom said.
"No, really. I can do it. It's okay."
Because you simply cannot draw these
things out forever. At some point, you
just pull off the Band-Aid and it hurts,
but then it's over and you're relieved.
"God, we'll miss you," Mom said
suddenly, stepping through the minefield
of suitcases to get to the bed. I stood and
hugged her.
My dad walked over, too, and we
formed a sort of huddle. It was too hot,
and we were too sweaty, for the hug to
last terribly long. I knew I ought to cry,
but I'd lived with my parents for sixteen
years, and a trial separation seemed
overdue.
"Don't worry." I smiled. "I's a-gonna
learn how t'talk right Southern." Mom
laughed.
"Don't do anything stupid," my dad
said.
"Okay."
"No drugs. No drinking. No
cigarettes." As an alumnus of Culver
Creek, he had done the things I had only
heard about: the secret parties, streaking
through hay fields (he always whined
about how it was all boys back then),
drugs, drinking, and cigarettes. It had
taken him a while to kick smoking, but
his badass days were now well behind
him.
"I love you," they both blurted out
simultaneously. It needed to be said, but
the words made the whole thing horribly
uncomfortable, like watching your
grandparents kiss.
"I love you, too. I'll call every
Sunday." Our rooms had no phone lines,
but my parents had requested I be placed
in a room near one of Culver Creek's
five pay phones.
They hugged me again — Mom, then
Dad — and it was over. Out the back
window, I watched them drive the
winding road off campus. I should have
felt a gooey, sentimental sadness,
perhaps. But mostly I just wanted to cool
off, so I grabbed one of the desk chairs
and sat down outside my door in the
shade of the overhanging eaves, waiting
for a breeze that never arrived. The air
outside sat as still and oppressive as the
air inside. I stared out over my new
digs: Six one-story buildings, each with
sixteen dorm rooms, were arranged in a
hexagram around a large circle of grass.
It looked like an oversize old motel.
Everywhere, boys and girls hugged and
smiled and walked together. I vaguely
hoped that someone would come up and
talk to me. I imagined the conversation:
"Hey. Is this your first year?"
"Yeah. Yeah. I'm from Florida."
"That's cool. So you're used to the
heat."
"I wouldn't be used to this heat if I
were from Hades," I'd joke. I'd make a
good first impression. Oh, he's funny.
That guy Miles is a riot.
That didn't happen, of course. Things
never happened like I imagined them.
Bored, I went back inside, took off
my shirt, lay down on the heat-soaked
vinyl of the lower bunk mattress, and
closed my eyes. I'd never been born
again with the baptism and weeping and
all that, but it couldn't feel much better
than being born again as a guy with no
known past. I thought of the people I'd
read about — JohnF.
Kennedy, James Joyce, Humphrey
Bogart — who went to boarding school,
and their adventures — Kennedy, for
example, loved pranks. I thought of the
Great Perhaps and the things that might
happen and the people I might meet and
who my roommate might be (I'd gotten a
letter a few weeks before that gave me
his name, Chip Martin, but no other
information). Whoever Chip Martin was,
I hoped to God he would bring an
arsenal of high-powered fans, because I
hadn't packed even one, and I could
already feel my sweat pooling on the
vinyl mattress, which disgusted me so
much that I stopped thinking and got off
my ass to find a towel to wipe up the
sweat with. And then I thought, Well,
before the adventure comes the
unpacking.
I managed to tape a map of the world
to the wall and get most of my clothes
into drawers before I noticed that the
hot, moist air made even the walls
sweat, and I decided that now was not
the time for manual labor. Now was the
time for a magnificently cold shower.
The small bathroom contained a
huge, full-length mirror behind the door,
and so I could not escape the reflection
of my naked self as I leaned in to turn on
the shower faucet. My skinniness always
surprised me: My thin arms didn't seem
to get much bigger as they moved from
wrist to shoulder, my chest lacked any
hint of either fat or muscle, and I felt
embarrassed and wondered if something
could be done about the mirror. I pulled
open the plain white shower curtain and
ducked into the stall.
Unfortunately, the shower seemed to
have been designed for someone
approximately three feet, seven inches
tall, so the cold water hit my lower rib
cage — with all the force of a dripping
faucet. To wet my sweat-soaked face, I
had to spread my legs and squat
significantly. Surely, John F. Kennedy
(who was six feet tall according to his
biography, my height exactly) did not
have to squat at his boarding school.
No, this was a different beast entirely,
and as the dribbling shower slowly
soaked my body, I wondered whether I
could find a Great Perhaps here at all or
whether I had made a grand
miscalculation.
When I opened the bathroom door
after my shower, a towel wrapped
around my waist, I saw a short, muscular
guy with a shock of brown hair. He was
hauling a gigantic army-green duffel bag
through the door of my room.
He stood five feet and nothing, but
was well-built, like a scale model of
Adonis, and with him arrived the stink of
stale cigarette smoke. Great, I thought.
I'm meeting my roommate naked. He
heaved the duffel into the room, closed
the door, and walked over to me.
"I'm Chip Martin," he announced in a
deep voice, the voice of a radio deejay.
Before I could respond, he added, "I'd
shake your hand, but I think you should
hold on damn tight to that towel till you
can get some clothes on."
I laughed and nodded my head at him
(that's cool, right? the nod?) and said,
"I'm Miles Halter. Nice to meet you."
"Miles, as in 'to go before I sleep'?"
he asked me.
"Huh?"
"It's a Robert Frost poem. You've
never read him?"
I shook my head no.
"Consider yourself lucky." He
smiled.
I grabbed some clean underwear, a
pair of blue Adidas soccer shorts, and a
white T-shirt, mumbled that I'd be back
in a second, and ducked back into the
bathroom. So much for a good first
impression.
"So where are your parents?" I asked
from the bathroom.
"My parents? The father's in
California right now. Maybe sitting in
his La-Z-Boy. Maybe driving his truck.
Either way, he's drinking. My mother is
probably just now turning off campus."
"Oh," I said, dressed now, not sure
how to respond to such personal
information. I shouldn't have asked, I
guess, if I didn't want to know.
Chip grabbed some sheets and
tossed them onto the top bunk. "I'm a top
bunk man. Hope that doesn't bother you."
"Uh, no. Whatever is fine."
"I see you've decorated the place,"
he said, gesturing toward the world map.
"I like it."
And then he started naming
countries. He spoke in a monotone, as if
he'd done it a thousand times before.
Afghanistan.
Albania.
Algeria.
American Samoa.
Andorra.
And so on. He got through the A's
before looking up and noticing my
incredulous stare.
"I could do the rest, but it'd probably
bore you. Something I learned over the
summer. God, you can't imagine how
boring New Hope, Alabama, is in the
summertime. Like watching soybeans
grow. Where are you from, by the way?"
"Florida," I said.
"Never been."
"That's pretty amazing, the countries
thing," I said.
"Yeah, everybody's got a talent. I can
memorize things. And you can…?"
"Urn, I know a lot of people's last
words." It was an indulgence, learning
last words. Other people had chocolate;
I had dying declarations.
"Example?"
"I like Henrik Ibsen's. He was a
playwright." I knew a lot about Ibsen,
but I'd never read any of his plays. I
didn't like reading plays. I liked reading
biographies.
"Yeah, I know who he was," said
Chip.
"Right, well, he'd been sick for a
while and his nurse said to him, 'You
seem to be feeling better this morning/
and Ibsen looked at her and said, Òn the
contrary,' and then he died."
Chip laughed. "That's morbid. But I
like it."
He told me he was in his third year
at Culver Creek. He had started in ninth
grade, the first year at the school, and
was now a junior like me. A scholarship
kid, he said. Got a full ride. He'd heard
it was the best school in Alabama, so he
wrote his application essay about how
he wanted to go to a school where he
could read long books. The problem, he
said in the essay, was that his dad would
always hit him with the books in his
house, so Chip kept his books short and
paperback for his own safety. His
parents got divorced his sophomore
year. He liked "the Creek," as he called
it, but "You have to be careful here, with
students and with teachers. And I do hate
being careful." He smirked. I hated being
careful, too — or wanted to, at least.
He told me this while ripping
through his duffel bag, throwing clothes
into drawers with reckless abandon.
Chip did not believe in having a sock
drawer or a T-shirt drawer. He believed
that all drawers were created equal and
filled each with whatever fit. My mother
would have died.
As soon as he finished "unpacking,"
Chip hit me roughly on the shoulder,
said, "I hope you're stronger than you
look," and walked out the door, leaving
it open behind him. He peeked his head
back in a few seconds later and saw me
standing still. "Well, come on, Miles To
Go Halter. We got shit to do."
We made our way to the TV room,
which according to Chip contained the
only cable TV on campus. Over the
summer, it served as a storage unit.
Packed nearly to the ceiling with
couches, fridges, and rolled-up carpets,
the TV room undulated with kids trying
to find and haul away their stuff. Chip
said hello to a few people but didn't
introduce me. As he wandered through
the couch-stocked maze, I stood near the
room's entrance, trying my best not to
block pairs of roommates as they
maneuvered furniture through the narrow
front door.
It took ten minutes for Chip to find
his stuff, and an hour more for us to
make four trips back and forth across the
dorm circle between the TV room and
Room 43. By the end, I wanted to crawl
into Chip's minifridge and sleep for a
thousand years, but Chip seemed immune
to both fatigue and heatstroke. I sat down
on his couch.
"I found it lying on a curb in my
neighborhood a couple years ago," he
said of the couch as he worked on setting
up my PlayStation 2 on top of his
footlocker. "I know the leather's got
some cracks, but come on. That's a damn
nice couch." The leather had more than a
few cracks — it was about 30 percent
baby blue faux leather and 70 percent
foam — but it felt damn good to me
anyway.
"All right," he said. "We're about
done." He walked over to his desk and
pulled a roll of duct tape from a drawer.
"We just need your trunk."
I got up, pulled the trunk out from
under the bed, and Chip situated it
between the couch and the PlayStation 2
and started tearing off thin strips of duct
tape. He applied them to the trunk so that
they spelled outcoffee table.
"There," he said. He sat down and
put his feet up on the, uh, coffee table.
"Done."
I sat down next to him, and he looked
over at me and suddenly said, "Listen.
I'm not going to be your entree to Culver
Creek social life."
"Uh, okay," I said, but I could hear
the words catch in my throat. I'd just
carried this guy's couch beneath a whitehot
sun and now he didn't like me?
"Basically you've got two groups
here," he explained, speaking with
increasing urgency. "You've got the
regular boarders, like me, and then
you've got the Weekday Warriors; they
board here, but they're all rich kids who
live in Birmingham and go home to their
parents' air-conditioned mansions every
weekend. Those are the cool kids. I don't
like them, and they don't like me, and so
if you came here thinking that you were
hot shit at public school so you'll be hot
shit here, you'd best not be seen with me.
You did go to public school, didn't
you?"
"Uh…" I said. Absentmindedly, I
began picking at the cracks in the couch's
leather, digging my fingers into the
foamy whiteness.
"Right, you did, probably, because if
you had gone to a private school your
freakin' shorts would fit." He laughed.
I wore my shorts just below my hips,
which I thought was cool. Finally I said,
"Yeah, I went to public school. But I
wasn't hot shit there, Chip. I was regular
shit."
"Ha! That's good. And don't call me
Chip. Call me the Colonel."
I stifled a laugh. "The Colonel?"
"Yeah. The Colonel. And we'll call
you…hmm. Pudge."
"Huh?"
"Pudge," the Colonel said. "Because
you're skinny. It's called irony, Pudge.
Heard of it? Now, let's go get some
cigarettes and start this year off right."
He walked out of the room, again
just assuming I'd follow, and this time I
did. Mercifully, the sun was descending
toward the horizon. We walked five
doors down to Room 48. A dry-erase
board was taped to the door using duct
tape. In blue marker, it read: Alaska has
a single!
The Colonel explained to me that 1.
this was Alaska's room, and that 2. she
had a single room because the girl who
was supposed to be her roommate got
kicked out at the end of last year, and
that 3 . Alaska had cigarettes, although
the Colonel neglected to ask whether 4. I
smoked, which 5. I didn't.
He knocked once, loudly. Through
the door, a voice screamed, "Oh my God
come in you short little man because I
have the best story."
We walked in. I turned to close the
door behind me, and the Colonel shook
his head and said, "After seven, you
have to leave the door open if you're in a
girl's room," but I barely heard him
because the hottest girl in all of human
history was standing before me in cutoff
jeans and a peach tank top. And she was
talking over the Colonel, talking loud
and fast.
"So first day of summer, I'm in grand
old Vine Station with this boy named
Justin and we're at his house watching
TV on the couch — and mind you, I'm
already dating Jake — actually I'm still
dating him, miraculously enough, but
Justin is a friend of mine from when I
was a kid and so we're watching TV and
literally chatting about the SATs or
something, and Justin puts his arm
around me and I think, Oh that's nice,
we've been friends for so long and this
is totally comfortable, and we're just
chatting and then I'm in the middle of a
sentence about analogies or something
and like a hawk he reaches down and he
honks my boob. HONK. A much-toofirm,
two-to three-second HONK. And
the first thing I thought was Okay, how
do I extricate this claw from my boob
before it leaves permanent marks? and
the second thing I thought was God, I
can't wait to tell Takumi and the
Colonel."
The Colonel laughed. I stared,
stunned partly by the force of the voice
emanating from the petite (but God,
curvy) girl and partly by the gigantic
stacks of books that lined her walls. Her
library filled her bookshelves and then
overflowed into waist-high stacks of
books everywhere, piled haphazardly
against the walls. If just one of them
moved, I thought, the domino effect
could engulf the three of us in an
asphyxiating mass of literature.
"Who's the guy that's not laughing at
my very funny story?" she asked.
"Oh, right. Alaska, this is Pudge.
Pudge memorizes people's last words.
Pudge, this is Alaska. She got her boob
honked over the summer." She walked
over to me with her hand extended, then
made a quick move downward at the last
moment and pulled down my shorts.
"Those are the biggest shorts in the
state of Alabama!"
"I like them baggy," I said,
embarrassed, and pulled them up. They
had been cool back home in Florida.
"So far in our relationship, Pudge,
I've seen your chicken legs entirely too
often," the Colonel deadpanned. "So,
Alaska. Sell us some cigarettes." And
then somehow, the Colonel talked me
into paying five dollars for a pack of
Marlboro Lights I had no intention of
ever smoking. He asked Alaska to join
us, but she said, "I have to find Takumi
and tell him about The Honk." She
turned to me and asked, "Have you seen
him?" I had no idea whether I'd seen
Takumi, since I had no idea who he was.
I just shook my head.
"All right. Meet ya at the lake in a
few minutes, then." The Colonel nodded.
At the edge of the lake, just before
the sandy (and, the Colonel told me,
fake) beach, we sat down in an
Adirondack swing. I made the obligatory
joke: "Don't grab my boob." The
Colonel gave an obligatory laugh, then
asked, "Want a smoke?" I had never
smoked a cigarette, but when in Rome…
"Is it safe here?"
"Not really," he said, then lit a
cigarette and handed it to me. I inhaled.
Coughed. Wheezed. Gasped for breath.
Coughed again. Considered
vomiting. Grabbed the swinging bench,
head spinning, and threw the cigarette to
the ground and stomped on it, convinced
my Great Perhaps did not involve
cigarettes.
"Smoke much?" He laughed, then
pointed to a white speck across the lake
and said, "See that?"
"Yeah," I said. "What is that? A
bird?"
"It's the swan," he said.
"Wow. A school with a swan.
Wow."
"That swan is the spawn of Satan.
Never get closer to it than we are now."
"Why?"
"It has some issues with people. It
was abused or something. It'll rip you to
pieces. The Eagle put it there to keep us
from walking around the lake to smoke."
"The Eagle?"
"Mr. Starnes. Code name: the Eagle.
The dean of students. Most of the
teachers live on campus, and they'll all
bust you. But only the Eagle lives in the
dorm circle, and he sees all. He can
smell a cigarette from like five miles."
"Isn't his house back there?" I asked,
pointing to it. I could see the house quite
clearly despite the darkness, so it
followed he could probably see us.
"Yeah, but he doesn't really go into
blitzkrieg mode until classes start," Chip
said nonchalantly.
"God, if I get in trouble my parents
will kill me," I said.
"I suspect you're exaggerating. But
look, you're going to get in trouble.
Ninety-nine percent of the time, your
parents never have to know, though. The
school doesn't want your parents to think
you became a fuckup here any more than
you want your parents to think you're a
fuckup." He blew a thin stream of smoke
forcefully toward the lake. I had to
admit: He looked cool doing it. Taller,
somehow. "Anyway, when you get in
trouble, just don't tell on anyone. I mean,
I hate the rich snots here with a fervent
passion I usually reserve only for dental
work and my father. But that doesn't
mean I would rat them out. Pretty much
the only important thing is never never
never never rat."
"Okay," I said, although I wondered:
If someone punches me in the face, I'm
supposed to insist that I ran into a
door? It seemed a little stupid. How do
you deal with bullies and assholes if you
can't get them into trouble? I didn't ask
Chip, though.
"All right, Pudge. We have reached
the point in the evening when I'm obliged
to go and find my girlfriend. So give me
a few of those cigarettes you'll never
smoke anyway, and I'll see you later."
I decided to hang out on the swing
for a while, half because the heat had
finally dissipated into a pleasant, if
muggy, eighty-something, and half
because I thought Alaska might show up.
But almost as soon as the Colonel left,
the bugs encroached: no-see-ums
(which, for the record, you can see) and
mosquitoes hovered around me in such
numbers that the tiny noise of their
rubbing wings sounded cacophonous.
And then I decided to smoke.
Now, I did think, The smoke will
drive the bugs away. And, to some
degree, it did. I'd be lying, though, if I
claimed I became a smoker to ward off
insects. I became a smoker because 1. I
was on an Adirondack swing by myself,
and 2. I had cigarettes, and 3. I figured
that if everyone else could smoke a
cigarette without coughing, I could damn
well, too. In short, I didn't have a very
good reason. So yeah, let's just say that
4. it was the bugs.
I made it through three entire drags
before I felt nauseous and dizzy and only
semipleasantly buzzed. I got up to leave.
As I stood, a voice behind me said: "So
do you really memorize last words?"
She ran up beside me and grabbed
my shoulder and pushed me back onto
the porch swing.
"Yeah," I said. And then hesitantly, I
added, "You want to quiz me?"
"JFK," she said.
"That's obvious," I answered.
"Oh, is it now?" she asked.
"No. Those were his last words.
Someone said, `Mr. President, you can't
say Dallas doesn't love you,' and then he
said, 'That's obvious,' and then he got
shot."
She laughed. "God, that's awful. I
shouldn't laugh. But I will," and then she
laughed again. "Okay, Mr. Famous Last
Words Boy. I have one for you." She
reached into her overstuffed backpack
and pulled out a book. "Gabriel Garcia
Ma r q ue z . The General in His
Labyrinth. Absolutely one of my
favorites. It's about Simon Bolivar." I
didn't know who Simon Bolivar was, but
she didn't give me time to ask. "It's a
historical novel, so I don't know if this is
true, but in the book, do you know what
his last words are? No, you don't. But I
am about to tell you, Senor Parting
Remarks."
And then she lit a cigarette and
sucked on it so hard for so long that I
thought the entire thing might burn off in
one drag. She exhaled and read to me:
"'He'—that's Simon Bolivar—*was
shaken by the overwhelming revelation
that the headlong race between his
misfortunes and his dreams was at that
moment reaching the finish line. The rest
was darkness. "Damn it," he sighed.
"How will I ever get out of this
labyrinth!'"" I knew great last words
when I heard them, and I made a mental
note to get a hold of a biography of this
Simon Bolivar fellow. Beautiful last
words, but I didn't quite understand. "So
what's the labyrinth?" I asked her.
And now is as good a time as any to
say that she was beautiful. In the dark
beside me, she smelled of sweat and
sunshine and vanilla, and on that thinmooned
night I could see little more than
her silhouette except for when she
smoked, when the burning cherry of the
cigarette washed her face in pale red
light. But even in the dark, I could see
her eyes — fierce emeralds. She had the
kind of eyes that predisposed you to
supporting her every endeavor. And not
just beautiful, but hot, too, with her
breasts straining against her tight tank
top, her curved legs swinging back and
forth beneath the swing, flip-flops
dangling from her electric-blue-painted
toes. It was right then, between when I
asked about the labyrinth and when she
answered me, that I realized the
importance of curves, of the thousand
places where girls' bodies ease from one
place to another, from arc of the foot to
ankle to calf, from calf to hip to waist to
breast to neck to ski-slope nose to
forehead to shoulder to the concave arch
of the back to the butt to the etc. I'd
noticed curves before, of course, but I
had never quite apprehended their
significance.
Her mouth close enough to me that I
could feel her breath warmer than the
air, she said, "That's the mystery, isn't it?
Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is
he trying to escape — the world or the
end of it?" I waited for her to keep
talking, but after a while it became
obvious she wanted an answer.
"Uh, I don't know," I said finally.
"Have you really read all those books in
your room?"
She laughed. "Oh God no. I've
maybe read a third of 'em. But I'm going
to read them all. I call it my Life's
Library. Every summer since I was little,
I've gone to garage sales and bought all
the books that looked interesting. So I
always have something to read. But there
is so much to do: cigarettes to smoke,
sex to have, swings to swing on. I'll have
more time for reading when I'm old and
boring."
She told me that I reminded her of
the Colonel when he came to Culver
Creek. They were freshmen together, she
said, both scholarship kids with, as she
put it, "a shared interest in booze and
mischief." The phrase booze and
mischief left me worrying I'd stumbled
into what my mother referred to as "the
wrong crowd," but for the wrong crowd,
they both seemed awfully smart. As she
lit a new cigarette off the butt of her
previous one, she told me that the
Colonel was smart but hadn't done much
living when he got to the Creek.
"I got rid of that problem quickly."
She smiled. "By November, I'd gotten
him his first girlfriend, a perfectly nice
non-Week day Warrior named Janice.
He dumped her after a month because
she was too rich for his poverty-soaked
blood, but whatever. We pulled our first
prank that year — we filled Classroom 4
with a thin layer of marbles. We've
progressed some since then, of course."
She laughed. So Chip became the
Colonel — the military-style planner of
their pranks, and Alaska was ever
Alaska, the larger-than-life creative
force behind them.
"You're smart like him," she said.
"Quieter, though. And cuter, but I didn't
even just say that, because I love my
boyfriend."
"Yeah, you're not bad either," I said,
overwhelmed by her compliment. "But I
didn't just say that, because I love my
girlfriend. Oh, wait. Right. I don't have
one."
She laughed. "Yeah, don't worry,
Pudge. If there's one thing I can get you,
it's a girlfriend. Let's make a deal: You
figure out what the labyrinth is and how
to get out of it, and I'll get you laid."
"Deal." We shook on it.
Later, I walked toward the dorm
circle beside Alaska. The cicadas
hummed their one-note song, just as they
had at home in Florida. She turned to me
as we made our way through the
darkness and said, "When you're
walking at night, do you ever get
creeped out and even though it's silly
and embarrassing you just want to run
home?"
It seemed too secret and personal to
admit to a virtual stranger, but I told her,
"Yeah, totally."
For a moment, she was quiet. Then
she grabbed my hand, whispered, "Run
run run run run," and took off, pulling me
behind her.
one hundred
twenty-seven days
before
Early the next afternoon,I blinked
sweat from my eyes as I taped a van
Gogh poster to the back of the door. The
Colonel sat on the couch judging
whether the poster was level and
fielding my endless questions about
Alaska.
What's her story? "She's from Vine
Station. You could drive past it without
noticing — and from what I understand,
you ought to. Her boyfriend's at
Vanderbilt on scholarship. Plays bass in
some band. Don't know much about her
family." So she really likes him? "I
guess. She hasn't cheated on him, which
is a first." And so on.
All morning, I'd been unable to care
about anything else, not the van Gogh
poster and not video games and not even
my class schedule, which the Eagle had
brought by that morning. He introduced
himself, too: "Welcome to Culver Creek,
Mr. Halter. You're given a large
measure of freedom here. If you abuse it,
you'll regret it. You seem like a nice
young man. I'd hate to have to bid you
farewell."
And then he stared at me in a manner
that was either serious or seriously
malicious. "Alaska calls that the Look of
Doom," the Colonel told me after the
Eagle left. "The next time you see that,
you're busted."
"Okay, Pudge," the Colonel said as I
stepped away from the poster. Not
entirely level, but close enough. "Enough
with the Alaska already. By my count,
there are ninety-two girls at this school,
and every last one of them is less crazy
than Alaska, who, I might add, already
has a boyfriend. I'm going to lunch. It's
bufriedo day." He walked out, leaving
the door open. Feeling like an
overinfatuated idiot, I got up to close the
door. The Colonel, already halfway
across the dorm circle, turned around.
"Christ. Are you coming or what?"
You can say a lot of bad things about
Alabama, but you can't say that
Alabamans as a people are unduly afraid
of deep fryers. In that first week at the
Creek, the cafeteria served fried
chicken, chicken-fried steak, and fried
okra, which marked my first foray into
the delicacy that is the fried vegetable. I
half expected them to fry the iceberg
lettuce. But nothing matched the
bufriedo, a dish created by Maureen, the
amazingly (and understandably) obese
Culver Creek cook. A deep-fried bean
burrito, the bufriedo proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt that frying always
improves a food. Sitting with the
Colonel and five guys I didn't know at a
circular table in the cafeteria that
afternoon, I sank my teeth into the
crunchy shell of my first bufriedo and
experienced a culinary orgasm. My mom
cooked okay, but I immediately wanted
to bring Maureen home with me over
Thanksgiving.
The Colonel introduced me (as
"Pudge") to the guys at the wobbly
wooden table, but I only registered the
name Takumi, whom Alaska had
mentioned yesterday. A thin Japanese
guy only a few inches taller than the
Colonel, Takumi talked with his mouth
full as Ichewed slowly, savoring the
beany crunch.
"God," Takumi said to me, "there's
nothing like watching a man eat his first
bufriedo."
I didn't say much — partly because
no one asked me any questions and
partly because I just wanted to eat as
much as I could. But Takumi felt no such
modesty — he could, and did, eat and
chew and swallow while talking.
The lunch discussion centered on the
girl who was supposed to have been
Alaska's roommate, Marya, and her
boyfriend, Paul, who had been a
Weekday Warrior. They'd gotten kicked
out in the last week of the previous
school year, I learned, for what the
Colonel called "the Trifecta" — they
were caught committing three of Culver
Creek's expellable offenses at once.
Lying naked in bed together ("genital
contact" being offense #1), already
drunk (#2), they were smoking a joint
(#3) when the Eagle burst in on them.
Rumors had it that someone had ratted
them out, and Takumi seemed intent on
finding out who — intent enough,
anyway, to shout about it with his mouth
jam-packed with bufriedo.
"Paul was an asshole," the Colonel
said. "I wouldn't have ratted on them, but
anyone who shacks up with a Jaguardriving
Weekday Warrior like Paul
deserves what she gets."
"Dude," Takumi responded, "yaw
guhfwend," and then he swallowed a
bite of food, "is a Weekday Warrior."
"True." The Colonel laughed. "Much
to my chagrin, that is an incontestable
fact. But she is not as big an asshole as
Paul."
"Not quite." Takumi smirked. The
Colonel laughed again, and I wondered
why he wouldn't stand up for his
girlfriend. I wouldn't have cared if my
girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops
with a beard — I'd have been grateful
just to have someone to make out with.
That evening, when the Colonel
dropped by Room 43 to pick up the
cigarettes (he seemed to have forgotten
that they were, technically, mine), I
didn't really care when he didn't invite
me out with him. In public school, I'd
known plenty of people who made it a
habit to hate this kind of person or that
kind — the geeks hated the preps, etc. —
and it always seemed like a big waste of
time to me. The Colonel didn't tell me
where he'd spent the afternoon, or where
he was going to spend the evening, but
he closed the door behind him when he
left, so I guessed I wasn't welcome.
Just as well: I spent the night surfing
the Web (no porn, I swear) and reading
The Final Days, a book about Richard
Nixon and Watergate. For dinner, I
microwaved a refrigerated bufriedo the
Colonel had snuck out of the cafeteria. It
reminded me of nights in Florida —
except with better food and no airconditioning.
Lying in bed and reading
felt pleasantly familiar.
I decided to heed what I'm sure
would have been my mother's advice
and get a good night's sleep before my
first day of classes. French II started at
8:10, and figuring it couldn't take more
than eight minutes to put on some clothes
and walk to the classrooms, I set my
alarm for 8:02. I took a shower, and then
lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me
from the heat. Around 11:00, I realized
that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might
make more of a difference if I took off
my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top
of the sheets wearing just boxers.
A decision I found myself regretting
some hours later when I awoke to two
sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy
hell out of me. I woke up completely and
instantly, sitting up straight in bed,
terrified, and I couldn't understand the
voices for some reason, couldn't
understand why there were any voices at
all, and what the hell time was it
anyway? And finally my head cleared
enough to hear, "C'mon, kid. Don't make
us kick your ass. Just get up," and then
from the top bunk, I heard, "Christ,
Pudge. Just get up." So I got up, and saw
for the first time three shadowy figures.
Two of them grabbed me, one with a
hand on each of my upper arms, and
walked me out of the room. On the way
out, the Colonel mumbled, "Have a good
time. Go easy on him, Kevin."
They led me, almost at a jog, behind
my dorm building, and then across the
soccer field. The ground was grassy but
gravelly, too, and I wondered why no
one had shown the common courtesy to
tell me to put on shoes, and why was I
out there in my underwear, chicken legs
exposed to the world? A thousand
humiliations crossed my mind: There's
the new junior, Miles Halter,
handcuf ed to the soccer goal wearing
only his boxers. I imagined them taking
me into the woods, where we now
seemed headed, and beating the shit out
of me so that I looked great for my first
day of school. And the whole time, I just
stared at my feet, because I didn't want
to look at them and I didn't want to fall,
so I watched my steps, trying to avoid
the bigger rocks. I felt the fight-or-fIight
reflex swell up in me over and over
again, but I knew that neither fight nor
flight had ever worked for me before.
They took me a roundabout way to the
fake beach, andthen I knew what would
happen — a good, old-fashioned
dunking in the lake — and I calmed
down. I could handle that.
When we reached the beach, they
told me to put my arms at my sides, and
the beefiest guy grabbed two rolls of
duct tape from the sand. With my arms
flat against my sides like a soldier at
attention, they mummified me from my
shoulder to my wrists. Then they threw
me down on the ground; the sand from
the fake beach cushioned the landing, but
I still hit my head. Two of them pulled
my legs together while the other one —
Kevin, I'd figured output his angular,
strong-jawed face up so close to mine
that the gel-soaked spikes of hair
pointing out from his forehead poked at
my face, and told me, "This is for the
Colonel. You shouldn't hang out with
that asshole." They taped my legs
together, from ankles to thighs. I looked
like a silver mummy. I said, "Please
guys, don't," just before they taped my
mouth shut. Then they picked me up and
hurled me into the water.
Sinking. Sinking, but instead of
feeling panic or anything else, I realized
that "Please guys, don't" were terrible
last words. But then the great miracle of
the human species — our buoyancy —
came through, and as I felt myself
floating toward the surface, I twisted and
turned as best I could so that the warm
night air hit my nose first, and I breathed.
I wasn't dead and wasn't going to die.
Well,I thought, that wasn't so bad.
But there was still the small matter
of getting to shore before the sun rose.
First, to determine my position vis-avis
the shoreline. If I tilted my head too
much, I felt my whole body start to roll,
and on the long list of unpleasant ways
to die, "facedown in soaking-wet white
boxers" is pretty high up there. So
instead I rolled my eyes and craned my
neck back, my eyes almost underwater,
until I saw that the shore — not ten feet
away — was directly behind my head. I
began to swim, an armless silver
mermaid, using only my hips to generate
motion, until finally my ass scraped
against the lake's mucky bottom. I turned
then and used my hips and waist to roll
three times, until I came ashore near a
ratty green towel. They'd left me a
towel. How thoughtful.
The water had seeped under the duct
tape and loosened the adhesive's grip on
my skin, but the tape was wrapped
around me three layers deep in places,
which necessitated wiggling like a fish
out of water. Finally it loosened enough
for me to slip my left hand up and out
against my chest and rip the tape off.
I wrapped myself in the sandy towel.
I didn't want to go back to my room and
see Chip, because I had no idea what
Kevin had meant — maybe if I went
back to the room, they'd be waiting for
me and they'd get me for real; maybe I
needed to show them, "Okay. Got your
message. He's just my roommate, not my
friend." And anyway, I didn't feel
terribly friendly toward the Colonel.
Have a good time, he'd said. Yeah, I
thought. / had a ball.
So I went to Alaska's room. I didn't
know what time it was, but I could see a
faint light underneath her door. I knocked
softly.
"Yeah," she said, and I came in, wet
and sandy and wearing only a towel and
soaking boxers. This was not, obviously,
how you want the world's hottest girl to
see you, but I figured she could explain
to me what had just happened.
She put down a book and got out of
bed with a sheet wrapped around her
shoulders. For a moment, she looked
concerned. She looked like the girl I met
yesterday, the girl who said I was cute
and bubbled over with energy and
silliness and intelligence. And then she
laughed.
"Guess you went for a swim, huh?"
And she said it with such casual malice
that I felt that everyone had known, and I
wondered why the whole damn school
agreed in advance to possibly drown
Miles Halter. But Alaska liked the
Colonel, and in the confusion of the
moment, I just looked at her blankly,
unsure even of what to ask.
"Give me a break," she said. "Come
on. You know what? There are people
with real problems. I've got real
problems. Mommy ain't here, so buck
up, big guy."
I left without saying a word to her
and went to my room, slamming the door
behind me, waking the Colonel, and
stomping into the bathroom. I got in the
shower to wash the algae and the lake
off me, but the ridiculous faucet of a
shower head failed spectacularly, and
how could Alaska and Kevin and those
other guys already dislike me?
After I finished the shower, I dried
off and went into the room to find some
clothes.
"So," he said. "What took you so
long? Get lost on your way home?"
"They said it was because of you," I
said, and my voice betrayed a hint of
annoyance. "They said I shouldn't hang
out with you."
"What? No, it happens to
everybody," the Colonel said. "It
happened to me. They throw you in the
lake. You swim out. You walk home."
"I couldn't just swim out," I said
softly, pulling on a pair of jean shorts
beneath my towel. "They duct-taped me.
I couldn't even move, really."
"Wait. Wait," he said, and hopped
out of his bunk, staring at me through the
darkness. "They taped you? How?"
And I showed him: I stood like a
mummy, with my feet together and my
hands at my sides, and showed him how
they'd wrapped me up. And then I
plopped down onto the couch.
"Christ! You could have drowned!
They're just supposed to throw you in the
water in your underwear and run!"
he shouted. "What the hell were they
thinking? Who was it? Kevin Richman
and who else? Do you remember their
faces?"
"Yeah, I think."
"Why the hell would they do that?"
he wondered.
"Did you do something to them?" I
asked.
"No, but I'm sure as shit gonna do
something to 'em now. We'll get them."
"It wasn't a big deal. I got out fine."
"You could have died." And I could
have, I suppose. But I didn't.
"Well, maybe I should just go to the
Eagle tomorrow and tell him," I said.
"Absolutely not," he answered. He
walked over to his crumpled shorts lying
on the floor and pulled out a pack of
cigarettes. He lit two and handed one to
me. I smoked the whole goddamned
thing.
"You're not," he continued, "because
that's not how shit gets dealt with here.
And besides, you really don't want to get
a reputation for ratting. But we will deal
with those bastards, Pudge. I promise
you. They will regret messing with one
of my friends."
And if the Colonel thought that
calling me his friend would make me
stand by him, well, he was right.
"Alaska was kind of mean to me
tonight," I said. I leaned over, opened an
empty desk drawer, and used it as a
makeshift ashtray.
"Like I said, she's moody."
I went to bed wearing a T-shirt,
shorts, and socks. No matter how
miserably hot it got, I resolved, I would
sleep in my clothes every night at the
Creek, feeling — probably for the first
time in my life — the fear and
excitement of living in a place where
you never know what's going to happen
or when.
one hundred
twenty-six days
before
"Well,now it's war,"the Colonel
shouted the next morning. I rolled over
and looked at the clock: 7:52. My first
Culver Creek class, French, started in
eighteen minutes. I blinked a couple
times and looked up at the Colonel, who
was standing between the couch and the
coffee table, holding his well-worn,
once-white tennis shoes by the laces.
For a long time, he stared at me, and I
stared at him. And then, almost in slow
motion, a grin crept across the Colonel's
face.
"I've got to hand it to them," he said
finally. "That was pretty clever."
"What?" I asked.
"Last night — before they woke you
up, I guess — they pissed in my shoes."
"Are you sure?" I said, trying not to
laugh.
"Do you care to smell?" he asked,
holding the shoes toward me.
"Because I went ahead and smelled
them, and yes, I am sure. If there's one
thing I know, it's when I've just stepped
in another man's piss. It's like my mom
always says: `Ya think you's a-walkin'
on water, but turns out you just got piss
in your shoes.' Point those guys out to me
if you see them today," he added,
"because we need to figure out why
they're so, uh, pissed at me. And then we
need to go ahead and start thinking about
how we're going to ruin their miserable
little lives."
When I received the Culver Creek
Handbook over the summer and noticed
happily that the "Dress Code" section
contained only two words, casual
modesty, it never occurred to me that
girls would show up for class half
asleep in cotton pajama shorts, T-shirts,
and flip-flops. Modest, I guess, and
casual.
And there was something about girls
wearing pajamas (even if modest),
which might have made French at 8:10
in the morning bearable, if I'd had any
idea what Madame O'Malley was
talking about. Comment dis-tu "Oh my
God, I don't know nearly enough French
to pass French II" en francais? My
French I class back in Florida did not
prepare me for Madame O'Malley, who
skipped the "how was your summer"
pleasantries and dove directly into
something called the passe compose,
which is apparently a verb tense. Alaska
sat directly across from me in the circle
of desks, but she didn't look at me once
the entire class, even though I could
notice little but her. Maybe she could be
mean…but the way she talked that first
night about getting out of the labyrinth —
so smart. And the way her mouth curled
up on the right side all the time, like she
was preparing to smirk, like she'd
mastered the right half of the Mona
Lisa's inimitable smile…
From my room, the student
population seemed manageable, but it
overwhelmed me in the classroom area,
which was a single, long building just
beyond the dorm circle. The building
was split into fourteen rooms facing out
toward the lake. Kids crammed the
narrow sidewalks in front of the
classrooms, and even though finding my
classes wasn't hard (even with my poor
sense of direction, I could get from
French in Room 3 to precalc in Room
12), I felt unsettled all day. I didn't know
anyone and couldn't even figure out
whom I should be trying to know, and
the classes were hard, even on the first
day. My dad had told me I'd have to
study, and now I believed him.
The teachers were serious and smart
and a lot of them went by "Dr.," and so
when the time came for my last class
before lunch, World Religions, I felt
tremendous relief. A vestige from when
Culver Creek was a Christian boys'
school, I figured the World Religions
class, required of every junior and
senior, might be an easy A.
It was my only class all day where
the desks weren't arranged either in a
square or a circle, so, not wanting to
seem eager, I sat down in the third row
at 11:03. I was seven minutes early,
partly because I liked to be punctual, and
partly because I didn't have anyone to
chat with out in the halls. Shortly
thereafter, the Colonel came in with
Takumi, and they sat down on opposite
sides of me.
"I heard about last night," Takumi
said. "Alaska's pissed."
"That's weird, since she was such a
bitch last night," I blurted out.
Takumi just shook his head. "Yeah,
well, she didn't know the whole story.
And people are moody, dude. You gotta
get used to living with people. You
could have worse friends than—" The
Colonel cut him off. "Enough with the
psychobabble, MC Dr. Phil. Let's talk
counterinsurgency." People were starting
to file into class, so the Colonel leaned
in toward me and whispered, "If any of
'em are in this class, let me know, okay?
Just, here, just put X's where they're
sitting," and he ripped a sheet of paper
out of his notebook and drew a square
for each desk. As people filed in, I saw
one of them — the tall one with
immaculately spiky hairKevin. Kevin
stared down the Colonel as he walked
past, but in trying to stare, he forgot to
watch his step and bumped his thigh
against a desk. The Colonel laughed.
One of the other guys, the one who was
either a little fat or worked out too much,
came in behind Kevin, sporting pleated
khaki pants and a short-sleeve black
polo shirt. As they sat down, I crossed
through the appropriate squares on the
Colonel's diagram and handed it to him.
Just then, the Old Man shuffled in.
He breathed slowly and with great
labor through his wide-open mouth. He
took tiny steps toward the lectern, his
heels not moving much past his toes. The
Colonel nudged me and pointed casually
to his notebook, which read, The Old
Man only has one lung, and I did not
doubt it. His audible, almost desperate
breaths reminded me of my grandfather
when he was dying of lung cancer.
Barrel-chested and ancient, the Old
Man, it seemed to me, might die before
he ever reached the podium.
"My name," he said, "is Dr. Hyde. I
have a first name, of course. So far as
you are concerned, it is Doctor. Your
parents pay a great deal of money so that
you can attend school here, and I expect
that you will offer them some return on
their investment by reading what I tell
you to read when I tell you to read it and
consistently attending this class. And
when you are here, you will listen to
what I say." Clearly not an easy A.
"This year, we'll be studying three
religious traditions: Islam, Christianity,
and Buddhism. We'll tackle three more
traditions next year. And in my classes, I
will talk most of the time, and you will
listen most of the time.
Because you may be smart, but I've
been smart longer. I'm sure some of you
do not like lecture classes, but as you
have probably noted, I'm not as young as
I used to be. I would love to spend my
remaining breath chatting with you about
the finer points of Islamic history, but
our time together is short. I must talk,
and you must listen, for we are engaged
here in the most important pursuit in
history: the search for meaning. What is
the nature of being a person? What is the
best way to go about being a person?
How did we come to be, and what will
become of us when we are no longer? In
short: What are the rules of this game,
and how might we best play it?"
The nature of the labyrinth,I
scribbled into my spiral notebook, and
the way out of it. This teacher rocked. I
hated discussion classes. I hated talking,
and I hated listening to everyone else
stumble on their words and try to phrase
things in the vaguest possible way so
they wouldn't sound dumb, and I hated
how it was all just a game of trying to
figure out what the teacher wanted to
hear and then saying it. I'm in class, so
teach me. And teach me he did: In those
fifty minutes, the Old Man made me take
religion seriously. I'd never been
religious, but he told us that religion is
important whether or not we believed in
one, in the same way that historical
events are important whether or not you
personally lived through them. And then
he assigned us fifty pages of reading for
the next day — from a book called
Religious Studies.
That afternoon, I had two classes and
two free periods. We had nine fiftyminute
class periods each day, which
means that most everyone had three
"study periods" (except for the Colonel,
who had an extra independent-study
math class on account of being an Extra
Special Genius). The Colonel and I had
biology together, where I pointed out the
other guy who'd duct-taped me the night
before. In the top corner of his notebook,
the Colonel wrote, Longwell Chase.
Senior W-day Warrior. Friends w/Sara.
Weird. It took me a minute to remember
who Sara was: the Colonel's girlfriend.
I spent my free periods in my room
trying to read about religion. I learned
that myth doesn't mean a lie; it means a
traditional story that tells you something
about people and their world view and
what they hold sacred.
Interesting. I also learned that after
the events of the previous night, I was
far too tired to care about myths or
anything else, so I slept on top of the
covers for most of the afternoon, until I
awoke to Alaska singing, "WAKE UP,
LITTLE PUHHHHHDGIE!" directly
into my left ear canal. I held the religion
book close up against my chest like a
small paperback security blanket.
"That was terrible," I said. "What do
I need to do to ensure that never happens
to me again?"
"Nothing you can do!" she said
excitedly. "I'm unpredictable. God, don't
you hate Dr. Hyde? Don't you? He's so
condescending."
I sat up and said, "I think he's a
genius," partly because I thought it was
true and partly because I just felt like
disagreeing with her.
She sat down on the bed. "Do you
always sleep in your clothes?"
"Yup."
"Funny," she said. "You weren't
wearing much last night." I just glared at
her.
"C'mon, Pudge. I'm teasing. You
have to be tough here. I didn't know how
bad it was — and I'm sorry, and they'll
regret it — but you have to be tough."
And then she left. That was all she had
to say on the subject. She's cute, I
thought, but you don't need to like a girl
who treats you like you're ten: You've
already got a mom.
one hundred
twenty-two days
before
After my last class of my first week
at Culver Creek, I entered Room 43 to
an unlikely sight: the diminutive and
shirtless Colonel, hunched over an
ironing board, attacking a pink buttondown
shirt. Sweat trickled down his
forehead and chest as he ironed with
great enthusiasm, his right arm pushing
the iron across the length of the shirt
with such vigor that his breathing nearly
duplicated Dr. Hyde's.
"I have a date," he explained. "This
is an emergency." He paused to catch his
breath. "Do you know" — breath—"how
to iron?"
I walked over to the pink shirt. It
was wrinkled like an old woman who'd
spent her youth sunbathing. If only the
Colonel didn't ball up his every
belonging and stuff it into random
dresser drawers. "I think you just turn it
on and press it against the shirt, right?" I
said. "I don't know. I didn't even know
we had an iron."
"We don't. It's Takumi's. But Takumi
doesn't know how to iron, either. And
when I asked Alaska, she started yelling,
`You're not going to impose the
patriarchal paradigm on me.' Oh, God, I
need to smoke. I need to smoke, but I
can't reek when I see Sara's parents.
Okay, screw it. We're going to smoke in
the bathroom with the shower on. The
shower has steam. Steam gets rid of
wrinkles, right?
"By the way," he said as I followed
him into the bathroom, "if you want to
smoke inside during the day, just turn on
the shower. The smoke follows the
steam up the vents."
Though this made no scientific sense,
it seemed to work. The shower's
shortage of water pressure and low
showerhead made it all but useless for
showering, but it worked great as a
smoke screen.
Sadly, it made a poor iron. The
Colonel tried ironing the shirt once more
("I'm just gonna push really hard and see
if that helps") and finally put it on
wrinkled. He matched the shirt with a
blue tie decorated with horizontal lines
of little pink flamingos.
"The one thing my lousy father taught
me," the Colonel said as his hands
nimbly threaded the tie into a perfect
knot, "was how to tie a tie. Which is
odd, since I can't imagine when he ever
had to wear one."
Just then, Sara knocked on the door.
I'd seen her once or twice before, but the
Colonel never introduced me to her and
didn't have a chance to that night.
"Oh. My God. Can't you at least
press your shirt?" she asked, even though
the Colonel was standing in front of the
ironing board.
"We're going out with my parents."
Sara looked awfully nice in her blue
summer dress. Her long, pale blond hair
was pulled up into a twist, with a strand
of hair falling down each side of her
face. She looked like a movie star — a
bitchy one.
"Look, I did my best. We don't all
have maids to do our ironing."
"Chip, that chip on your shoulder
makes you look even shorter."
"Christ, can't we get out the door
without fighting?"
"I'm just saying. It's the opera. It's a
big deal to my parents. Whatever. Let's
go." I felt like leaving, but it seemed
stupid to hide in the bathroom, and Sara
was standing in the doorway, one hand
cocked on her hip and the other fiddling
with her car keys as if to say, Let's go.
"I could wear a tuxedo and your
parents would still hate me!" he shouted.
"That's not my fault! You antagonize
them!" She held up the car keys in front
of him. "Look, we're going now or we're
not going."
"Fuck it. I'm not going anywhere
with you," the Colonel said.
"Fine. Have a great night." Sara
slammed the door so hard that a sizable
biography of Leo Tolstoy (last words:
"The truth is…I care a great deal…what
they…") fell off my bookshelf and
landed with a thud on our checkered
floor like an echo of the slamming door.
"AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"he screamed.
"So that's Sara," I said.
"Yes."
"She seems nice."
The Colonel laughed, knelt down
next to the mini fridge, and pulled out a
gallon of milk. He opened it, took a
swig, winced, half coughed, and sat
down on the couch with the milk
between his legs.
"Is it sour or something?"
"Oh, I should have mentioned that
earlier. This isn't milk. It's five parts
milk and one part vodka. I call it
ambrosia. Drink of the gods. You can
barely smell the vodka in the milk, so the
Eagle can't catch me unless he actually
takes a sip. The downside is that it tastes
like sour milk and rubbing alcohol, but
it's Friday night, Pudge, and my
girlfriend is a bitch. Want some?"
"I think I'll pass." Aside from a few
sips of champagne on New Year's under
the watchful eye of my parents, I'd never
really drunk any alcohol, and "ambrosia"
didn't seem like the drink with which to
start. Outside, I heard the pay phone
ring. Given the fact that 190 boarders
shared five pay phones, I was amazed at
how infrequently it rang. We weren't
supposed to have cell phones, but I'd
noticed that some of the Weekday
Warriors carried them surreptitiously.
And most non-Warriors called their
parents, as I did, on a regular basis, so
parents only called when their kids
forgot.
"Are you going to get that?" the
Colonel asked me. I didn't feel like
being bossed around by him, but I also
didn't feel like fighting.
Through a buggy twilight, I walked
to the pay phone, which was drilled into
the wall between Rooms 44 and 45.
On both sides of the phone, dozens
of phone numbers and esoteric notes
were written in pen and marker
(205.555.1584; Tommy to airport
4:20;773.573.6521; JG — Kuf s?).
Calling the pay phone required a great
deal of patience. I picked up on about
the ninth ring.
"Can you get Chip for me?" Sara
asked. It sounded like she was on a cell
phone.
"Yeah, hold on."
I turned, and he was already behind
me, as if he knew it would be her. I
handed him the receiver and walked
back to the room.
A minute later, three words made
their way to our room through the thick,
still air of Alabama at almost-night.
"Screw you too!" the Colonel
shouted.
Back in the room, he sat down with
his ambrosia and told me, "She says I
ratted out Paul and Marya. That's what
the Warriors are saying. That I ratted
them out. Me. That's why the piss in the
shoes. That's why the nearly killing you.
'Cause you live with me, and they say
I'm a rat."
I tried to remember who Paul and
Marya were. The names were familiar,
but I had heard so many names in the last
week, and I couldn't match "Paul" and
"Marya" with faces. And then I
remembered why: I'd never seen them.
They got kicked out the year before,
having committed the Trifecta.
"How long have you been dating
her?" I asked.
"Nine months. We never got along. I
mean, I didn't even briefly like her. Like,
my mom and my dad — my dad would
get pissed, and then he would beat the
shit out of my mom. And then my dad
would be all nice, and they'd have like a
honeymoon period. But with Sara,
there's never a honeymoon period. God,
how could she think I was a rat? I know,
I know: Why don't we break up?" He ran
a hand through his hair, clutching a
fistful of it atop his head, and said, "I
guess I stay with her because she stays
with me. And that's not an easy thing to
do. I'm a bad boyfriend. She's a bad
girlfriend. We deserve each other."
"But-" "I can't believe they think
that," he said as he walked to the
bookshelf and pulled down the almanac.
He took a long pull off his ambrosia.
"Goddamn Weekday Warriors. It was
probably one of them that ratted out Paul
and Marya and then blamed me to cover
their tracks. Anyway, it's a good night
for staying in. Staying in with Pudge and
ambrosia."
"I still—" I said, wanting to say that
I didn't understand how you could kiss
someone who believed you were a rat if
being a rat was the worst thing in the
world, but the Colonel cut me off.
"Not another word about it. You
know what the capital of Sierra Leone
is?"
"No."
"Me neither," he said, "but I intend to
find out." And with that, he stuck his
nose in the almanac, and the
conversation was over.
one hundred ten
days before
Keeping up with my classes proved
easier than I'd expected. My general
predisposition to spending a lot of time
inside reading gave me a distinct
advantage over the average Culver
Creek student. By the third week of
classes, plenty of kids had been
sunburned to a bufriedo-like golden
brown from days spent chatting outside
in the shadeless dorm circle during free
periods. But I was barely pink: I studied.
And I listened in class, too, but on
that Wednesday morning, when Dr. Hyde
started talking about how Buddhists
believe that all things are
interconnected, I found myself staring
out the window. I was looking at the
wooded, slow-sloping hill beyond the
lake. And from Hyde's classroom, things
did seem connected: The trees seemed to
clothe the hill, and just as I would never
think to notice a particular cotton thread
in the magnificently tight orange tank top
Alaska wore that day, I couldn't see the
trees for the forest — everything so
intricately woven together that it made
no sense to think of one tree as
independent from that hill. And then I
heard my name, and I knew I was in
trouble.
"Mr. Halter," the Old Man said.
"Here I am, straining my lungs for your
edification. And yet something out there
seems to have caught your fancy in a
way that I've been unable to do. Pray
tell: What have you discovered out
there?"
Now I felt my own breath shorten,
the whole class watching me, thanking
God they weren't me. Dr. Hyde had
already done this three times, kicking
kids out of class for not paying attention
or writing notes to one another.
"Urn, I was just looking outside at
the, uh, at the hill and thinking about, um,
the trees and the forest, like you were
saying earlier, about the way—" The
Old Man, who obviously did not tolerate
vocalized rambling, cut me off. "I'm
going to ask you to leave class, Mr.
Halter, so that you can go out there and
discover the relationship between the
um-trees and the uh-forest.
And tomorrow, when you're ready to
take this class seriously, I will welcome
you back."
I sat still, my pen resting in my hand,
my notebook open, my face flushed and
my jaw jutting out into an underbite, an
old trick I had to keep from looking sad
or scared. Two rows behind me, I heard
a chair move and turned around to see
Alaska standing up, slinging her
backpack over one arm.
"I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. You
can't just throw him out of class. You
drone on and on for an hour every day,
and we're not allowed to glance out the
window?"
The Old Man stared back at Alaska
like a bull at a matador, then raised a
hand to his sagging face and slowly
rubbed the white stubble on his cheek.
"For fifty minutes a day, five days a
week, you abide by my rules. Or you
fail. The choice is yours. Both of you
leave."
I stuffed my notebook into my
backpack and walked out, humiliated.
As the door shut behind me, I felt a tap
on my left shoulder. I turned, but there
was no one there. Then I turned the other
way, and Alaska was smiling at me, the
skin between her eyes and temple
crinkled into a starburst. "The oldest
trick in the book," she said, "but
everybody falls for it."
I tried a smile, but I couldn't stop
thinking about Dr. Hyde. It was worse
than the Duct Tape Incident, because I
always knew that the Kevin Richmans of
the world didn't like me. But my teachers
had always been card-carrying members
of the Miles Halter Fan Club.
"I told you he was an asshole," she
said.
"I still think he's a genius. He's right.
I wasn't listening."
"Right, but he didn't need to be a jerk
about it. Like he needs to prove his
power by humiliating you?! Anyway,"
she said, "the only real geniuses are
artists: Yeats, Picasso, Garcia Marquez:
geniuses. Dr. Hyde: bitter old man."
And then she announced we were
going to look for four-leaf clovers until
class ended and we could go smoke with
the Colonel and Takumi, "both of
whom," she added, "are big-time
assholes for not marching out of class
right behind us."
When Alaska Young is sitting with
her legs crossed in a brittle, periodically
green clover patch leaning forward in
search of four-leaf clovers, the pale skin
of her sizable cleavage clearly visible, it
is a plain fact of human physiology that it
becomes impossible to join in her clover
search. I'd gotten in enough trouble
already for looking where I wasn't
supposed to, but still…
After perhaps two minutes of
combing through a clover patch with her
long, dirty fingernails, Alaska grabbed a
clover with three full-size petals and an
undersize, runt of a fourth, then looked
up at me, barely giving me time to avert
my eyes.
"Even though you were dearly not
doing your part in the clover search,
perv," she said wryly, "I really would
give you this clover. Except luck is for
suckers." She pinched the runt petal
between the nails of her thumb and
finger and plucked it. "There," she said
to the clover as she dropped it onto the
ground. "Now you're not a genetic freak
anymore."
"Uh, thanks," I said. The bell rang,
and Takumi and the Colonel were first
out the door. Alaska stared at them.
"What?" asked the Colonel. But she
just rolled her eyes and started walking.
We followed in silence through the dorm
circle and then across the soccer field.
We ducked into the woods, following
the faint path around the lake until we
came to a dirt road. The Colonel ran up
to Alaska, and they started fighting about
something quietly enough that I couldn't
hear the words so much as the mutual
annoyance, and I finally asked Takumi
where we were headed.
"This road dead-ends into the barn,"
he said. "So maybe there. But probably
the smoking hole. You'll see."
From here, the woods were a totally
different creature than from Dr. Hyde's
classroom. The ground was thick with
fallen branches, decaying pine needles,
and brambly green bushes; the path
wound past pine trees sprouting tall and
thin, their stubbly needles providing a
lace of shade from another sunburned
day. And the smaller oak and maple
trees, which from Dr. Hyde's classroom
had been invisible beneath the more
majestic pines, showed hints of an asyet-thermally-unforeseeable
fall: Their
still-green leaves were beginning to
droop.
We came to a rickety wooden bridge
— just thick plywood laid over a
concrete foundation — over Culver
Creek, the winding rivulet that doubled
back over and over again through the
outskirts of campus. On the far side of
the bridge, there was a tiny path leading
down a steep slope. Not even a path so
much as a series of hints — a broken
branch here, a patch of stomped-down
grass there — that people had come this
way before. As we walked down single
file, Alaska, the Colonel, and Takumi
each held back a thick maple branch for
one another, passing it along until I, last
in line, let it snap back into place behind
me. And there, beneath the bridge, an
oasis. A slab of concrete, three feet
wide and ten feet long, with blue plastic
chairs stolen long ago from some
classroom. Cooled by the creek and the
shade of the bridge, I felt unhot for the
first time in weeks.
The Colonel dispensed the
cigarettes. Takumi passed; the rest of us
lit up.
"He has no right to condescend to us
is all I'm saying," Alaska said,
continuing her conversation with the
Colonel.
"Pudge is done with staring out the
window, and I'm done with going on
tirades about it, but he's a terrible
teacher, and you won't convince me
otherwise."
"Fine," the Colonel said. "Just don't
make another scene. Christ, you nearly
killed the poor old bastard."
"Seriously, you'll never win by
crossing Hyde," Takumi said.
"He'll eat you alive, shit you out, and
then piss on his dump. Which by the way
is what we should be doing to whoever
ratted on Marya. Has anyone heard
anything?"
"It must have been some Weekday
Warrior," Alaska said. "But apparently
they think it was the Colonel. So who
knows. Maybe the Eagle just got lucky.
She was stupid; she got caught; she got
expelled; it's over. That's what happens
when you're stupid and you get caught."
Alaska made an O with her lips, moving
her mouth like a goldfish eating, trying
unsuccessfully to blow smoke rings.
"Wow," Takumi said, "if I ever get
kicked out, remind me to even the score
myself, since I sure can't count on you."
"Don't be ridiculous," she
responded, not angry so much as
dismissive. "I don't understand why
you're so obsessed with figuring out
everything that happens here, like we
have to unravel every mystery. God, it's
over.
Takumi, you gotta stop stealing other
people's problems and get some of your
own." Takumi started up again, but
Alaska raised her hand as if to swat the
conversation away.
I said nothing — I hadn't known
Marya, and anyway, "listening quietly"
was my general social strategy.
"Anyway," Alaska said to me. "I
thought the way he treated you was just
awful. I wanted to cry. I just wanted to
kiss you and make it better."
"Shame you didn't," I deadpanned,
and they laughed.
"You're adorable," she said, and I
felt the intensity of her eyes on me and
looked away nervously. "Too bad I love
my boyfriend." I stared at the knotted
roots of the trees on the creek bank,
trying hard not to look like I'd just been
called adorable.
Takumi couldn't believe it either,
and he walked over to me, tussling my
hair with his hand, and started rapping to
Alaska. "Yeah, Pudge is adorable / but
you want incorrigible / so Jake is more
endurable / 'cause he's sodamn. Damn. I
almost had four rhymes on adorable. But
all I could think of was unfloorable,
which isn't even a word."
Alaska laughed. "That made me not
be mad at you anymore. God, rapping is
sexy. Pudge, did you even know that
you're in the presence of the sickest
emcee in Alabama?"
"Urn, no."
"Drop a beat, Colonel Catastrophe,"
Takumi said, and I laughed at the idea
that a guy as short and dorky as the
Colonel could have a rap name. The
Colonel cupped his hands around his
mouth and started making some absurd
noises that I suppose were intended to
be beats. Puh-chi. Puh-puhpuh-chi.
Takumi laughed.
"Right here, by the river, you want
me to kick it? / If your smoke was a
Popsicle, I'd surely lick it / My rhymin'
is old school, sort of like the ancient
Romans / The Colonel's beats is sad like
Arthur Miller's Willy Loman /
Sometimes I'm accused of being a
showman / ICanRhymeFast and I can
rhyme slow, man."
He paused, took a breath, and then
finished.
"Like Emily Dickinson, I ain't afraid
of slant rhyme / And that's the end of this
verse; emcee's out on a high."
I didn't know slant rhyme from
regular rhyme, but I was suitably
impressed. We gave Takumi a soft round
of applause. Alaska finished her
cigarette and flicked it into the river.
"Why do you smoke so damn fast?" I
asked.
She looked at me and smiled widely,
and such a wide smile on her narrow
face might have looked goofy were it not
for the unimpeachably elegant green in
her eyes. She smiled with all the delight
of a kid on Christmas morning and said,
"Y'all smoke to enjoy it. I smoke to die."
one hundred nine
days before
Dinner in the cafeteria the next night
was meat loaf, one of the rare dishes that
didn't arrive deep-fried, and, perhaps as
a result, meat loaf was Maureen's
greatest failure — a stringy, gravy-
soaked concoction that did not much
resemble a loaf and did not much taste
like meat. Although I'd never ridden in
it, Alaska apparently had a car, and she
offered to drive the Colonel and me to
McDonald's, but the Colonel didn't have
any money, and I didn't have much
either, what with constantly paying for
his extravagant cigarette habit.
So instead the Colonel and I
reheated two-day-old bufriedos —
unlike, say, french fries, a microwaved
bufriedo lost nothing of its taste or its
satisfying crunch — after which the
Colonel insisted on attending the Creek's
first basketball game of the season.
"Basketball in the fall?" I asked the
Colonel. "I don't know much about
sports, but isn't that when you play
football?"
"The schools in our league are too
small to have football teams, so we play
basketball in the fall. Although, man, the
Culver Creek football team would be a
thing of beauty. Your scrawny ass could
probably start at lineman.
Anyway, the basketball games are
great."
I hated sports. I hated sports, and I
hated people who played them, and I
hated people who watched them, and I
hated people who didn't hate people
who watched or played them. In third
grade — the very last year that one
could play T-ball — my mother wanted
me to make friends, so she forced me
onto the Orlando Pirates. I made friends
all right — with a bunch of
kindergartners, which didn't really
bolster my social standing with my
peers.
Primarily because I towered over the
rest of the players, I nearly made it onto
the T-ball all-star team that year.
The kid who beat me, Clay Wurtzel,
had one arm. I was an unusually tall
third grader with two arms, and I got
beat out by kindergartner Clay Wurtzel.
And it wasn't some pity-the-one-armedkid
thing, either. Clay Wurtzel could
flat-out hit, whereas I sometimes struck
out even with the ball sitting on the tee.
One of the things that appealed to me
most about Culver Creek was that my
dad assured me there was no PE
requirement.
"There is only one time when I put
aside my passionate hatred for the
Weekday Warriors and their countryclub
bullshit," the Colonel told me. "And
that's when they pump up the airconditioning
in the gym for a little oldfashioned
Culver Creek basketball. You
can't miss the first game of the year."
As we walked toward the airplane
hangar of a gym, which I had seen but
never even thought to approach, the
Colonel explained to me the most
important thing about our basketball
team: They were not very good. The
"star" of the team, the Colonel said, was
a senior named Hank Walsten, who
played power forward despite being
five-foot-eight. Hank's primary claim to
campus fame, I already knew, was that
he always had weed, and the Colonel
told me that for four years, Hank started
every game without ever once playing
sober.
"He loves weed like Alaska loves
sex," the Colonel said. "This is a man
who once constructed a bong using only
the barrel of an air rifle, a ripe pear, and
an eight-by-ten glossy photograph of
Anna Kournikova. Not the brightest gem
in the jewelry shop, but you've got to
admire his single-minded dedication to
drug abuse."
From Hank, the Colonel told me, it
went downhill until you reached Wilson
Carbod, the starting center, who was
almost six feet tall. "We're so bad," the
Colonel said, "we don't even have a
mascot. I call us the Culver Creek
Nothings."
"So they just suck?" I asked. I didn't
quite understand the point of watching
your terrible team get walloped, though
the air-conditioning was reason enough
for me.
"Oh, they suck," the Colonel replied.
"But we always beat the shit out of the
deaf-and-blind school." Apparently,
basketball wasn't a big priority at the
Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind,
and so we usually came out of the season
with a single victory.
When we arrived, the gym was
packed with most every Culver Creek
student — I noticed, for instance, the
Creek's three goth girls reapplying their
eyeliner as they sat on the top row of the
gym's bleachers. I'd never attended a
school basketball game back home, but I
doubted the crowds there were quite so
inclusive. Even so, I was surprised
when none other than Kevin Richman sat
down on the bleacher directly in front of
me while the opposing school's
cheerleading team (their unfortunate
school colors were mud-brown and
dehydrated-piss-yellow) tried to fire up
the small visitors' section in the crowd.
Kevin turned around and stared at the
Colonel.
Like most of the other guy Warriors,
Kevin dressed preppy, looking like a
lawyer-who-enjoys-golfing waiting to
happen. And his hair, a blond mop, short
on the sides and spiky on top, was
always soaked through with so much gel
that it looked perennially wet. I didn't
hate him like the Colonel did, of course,
because the Colonel hated him on
principle, and principled hate is a hell of
a lot stronger than "Boy, I wish you
hadn't mummified me and thrown me into
the lake" hate. Still, I tried to stare at
him intimidatingly as he looked at the
Colonel, but it was hard to forget that
this guy had seen my skinny ass in
nothing but boxers a couple weeks ago.
"You ratted out Paul and Marya. We
got you back. Truce?" Kevin asked.
"I didn't rat them out. Pudge here
certainly didn't rat them out, but you
brought him in on your fun. Truce?
Hmm, let me take a poll real quick."
The cheerleaders sat down, holding their
pompoms close to their chest as if
praying. "Hey, Pudge," the Colonel said.
"What do you think of a truce?"
"It reminds me of when the Germans
demanded that the U.S. surrender at the
Battle of the Bulge," I said. "I guess I'd
say to this truce offer what General
McAuliffe said to that one: Nuts."
"Why would you try to kill this guy,
Kevin? He's a genius. Nuts to your
truce."
"Come on, dude. I know you ratted
them out, and we had to defend our
friend, and now it's over. Let's end it."
He seemed very sincere, perhaps due to
the Colonel's reputation for pranking.
"I'll make you a deal. You pick one
dead American president. If Pudge
doesn't know that guy's last words, truce.
If he does, you spend the rest of your
life lamenting the day you pissed in my
shoes."
"That's retarded."
"All right, no truce," the Colonel
shot back.
"Fine. Millard Fillmore," Kevin
said. The Colonel looked at me
hurriedly, his eyes saying, Was that guy
a president? I just smiled.
"When Fillmore was dying, he was
super hungry. But his doctor was trying
to starve his fever or whatever.
Fillmore wouldn't shut up about
wanting to eat, though, so finally the
doctor gave him a tiny teaspoon of soup.
And all sarcastic, Fillmore said,
'The nourishment is palatable,' and then
died. No truce."
Kevin rolled his eyes and walked
away, and it occurred to me that I could
have made up any last words for Millard
Fillmore and Kevin probably would
have believed me if I'd used that same
tone of voice, the Colonel's confidence
rubbing off on me.
"That was your first badass
moment!" The Colonel laughed.
"Now, it's true that I gave you an
easy target. But still. Well done."
Unfortunately for the Culver Creek
Nothings, we weren't playing the deafand-blind
school. We were playing
some Christian school from downtown
Birmingham, a team stocked with huge,
gargantuan apemen with thick beards and
a strong distaste for turning the
othercheek.
At the end of the first quarter: 20-4.
And that's when the fun started. The
Colonel led all of the cheers.
"Cornbread!" he screamed.
"CHICKEN!" the crowd responded.
"Rice!"
"PEAS!"
And then, all together: "WE GOT
HIGHER SATs."
"Hip Hip Hip Hooray!" the Colonel
cried.
"YOU'LL BE WORKIN' FOR US
SOMEDAY!"
The opposing team's cheerleaders
tried to answer our cheers with "The
roof, the roof, the roof is on fire! Hell is
in your future if you give in to desire,"
but we could always do them one better.
"Buy!"
"SELL!"
"Trade!"
"BARTER!"
"YOU'RE MUCH BIGGER, BUT
WE ARE SMARTER!"
When the visitors shoot a free throw
on most every court in the country, the
fans make a lot of noise, screaming and
stomping their feet. It doesn't work,
because players learn to tune out white
noise. At Culver Creek, we had a much
better strategy. At first, everyone yelled
and screamed like in a normal game. But
then everyone said, "Shh!" and there was
absolute silence. Just as our hated
opponent stopped dribbling and
prepared for his shot, the Colonel stood
up and screamed something. Like: "For
the love of God, please shave your back
hair!" Or: "I need to be saved. Can you
minister to me after your shot?!"
Toward the end of the third quarter,
the Christian-school coach called a
time-out and complained to the ref about
the Colonel, pointing at him angrily. We
were down 56–13. The Colonel stood
up. "What?! You have a problem with
me!?"
The coach screamed, "You're
bothering my players!"
"THAT'S THE POINT,
SHERLOCK!" the Colonel screamed
back. The ref came over and kicked him
out of the gym. I followed him.
"I've gotten thrown out of thirtyseven
straight games," he said.
"Damn."
"Yeah. Once or twice, I've had to go
really crazy. I ran onto the court with
eleven seconds left once and stole the
ball from the other team. It wasn't pretty.
But, you know. I have a streak to
maintain."
The Colonel ran ahead of me, gleeful
at his ejection, and I jogged after him,
trailing in his wake. I wanted to be one
of those people who have streaks to
maintain, who scorch the ground with
their intensity. But for now, at least I
knew such people, and they needed me,
just like comets need tails.

The next day, Dr. Hyde asked me to
stay after class. Standing before him, I
realized for the first time how hunched
his shoulders were, and he seemed
suddenly sad and kind of old. "You like
this class, don't you?" he asked.
"Yes sir."
"You've got a lifetime to mull over
the Buddhist understanding of
interconnectedness." He spoke every
sentence as if he'd written it down,
memorized it, and was now reciting it.
"But while you were looking out the
window, you missed the chance to
explore the equally interesting Buddhist
belief in being present for every facet of
your daily life, of being truly present. Be
present in this class. And then, when it's
over, be present out there," he said,
nodding toward the lake and beyond.
"Yes sir."

On the first morning of October, I
knew something was wrong as soon as I
woke up enough to turn off the alarm
clock. The bed didn't smell right. And I
didn't feel right. It took me a groggy
minute before I realized: I felt cold.
Well, at the very least, the small fan
clipped to my bunk seemed suddenly
unnecessary. "It's cold!" I shouted.
"Oh God, what time is it?" I heard
above me.
"Eight-oh-four,"I said.
The Colonel, who didn't have an
alarm clock but almost always woke up
to take a shower before mine went off,
swung his short legs over the side of the
bed, jumped down, and dashed to his
dresser.
"I suppose I missed my window of
opportunity to shower," he said as he put
on a greenculver creek basketball Tshirt
and a pair of shorts. "Oh well.
There's always tomorrow. And it's not
cold. It's probably eighty."
Grateful to have slept fully dressed, I
just put on shoes, and the Colonel and I
jogged to the classrooms. I slid into my
seat with twenty seconds to spare.
Halfway through class, Madame
O'Malley turned around to write
something in French on the blackboard,
and Alaska passed me a note.
Nice bedhead. Study at McDonald's
for lunch?
Our first significant precalc test was
only two days away, so Alaska grabbed
the six precalc kids she did not consider
Weekday Warriors and piled us into her
tiny blue two-door. By happy
coincidence, a cute sophomore named
Lara ended up sitting on my lap. Lara'd
been born in Russia or someplace, and
she spoke with a slight accent. Since we
were only four layers of clothes from
doing it, I took the opportunity to
introduce myself.
"I know who you are." She smiled.
"You're Alaska's freend from Flow
Reeda."
"Yup. Get ready for a lot of dumb
questions, 'cause I suck at precalc," I
said.
She started to answer, but then she
was thrown back against me as Alaska
shot out of the parking lot.
"Kids, meet Blue Citrus. So named
because she is a lemon," Alaska said.
"Blue Citrus, meet the kids. If you can
find them, you might want to fasten your
seat belts. Pudge, you might want to
serve as a seat belt for Lara." What the
car lacked in speed, Alaska made up for
by refusing to move her foot from the
accelerator, damn the consequences.
Before we even got off campus, Lara
was lurching helplessly whenever
Alaska took hard turns, so I took
Alaska's advice and wrapped my arms
around Lara's waist.
"Thanks," she said, almost inaudibly.
After a fast if reckless three miles to
McDonald's, we ordered seven large
french fries to share and then went
outside and sat on the lawn. We sat in a
circle around the trays of fries, and
Alaska taught class, smoking while she
ate.
Like any good teacher, she tolerated
little dissension. She smoked and talked
and ate for an hour without stopping, and
I scribbled in my notebook as the muddy
waters of tangents and cosines began to
clarify. But not everyone was so
fortunate.
As Alaska zipped through something
obvious about linear equations,
stoner/baller Hank Walsten said, "Wait,
wait. I don't get it."
"That's because you have eight
functioning brain cells."
"Studies show that marijuana is
better for your health than those
cigarettes," Hank said.
Alaska swallowed a mouthful of
french fries, took a drag on her cigarette,
and blew smoke across the table at
Hank. "I may die young," she said. "But
at least I'll die smart. Now, back to
tangents."
one hundred days
before
"Not to ask the obvious question, but
why Alaska?" I asked. I'd just gotten my
precalc test back, and I was awash with
admiration for Alaska, since her tutoring
had paved my way to a B-plus. She and I
sat alone in the TV lounge watching
MTV on a drearily cloudy Saturday.
Furnished with couches left behind by
previous generations of Culver Creek
students, the TV room had the musty air
of dust and mildew — and, perhaps for
that reason, was almost perennially
unoccupied. Alaska took a sip of
Mountain Dew and grabbed my hand in
hers.
"Always comes up eventually. All
right, so my mom was something of a
hippie when I was a kid. You know,
wore oversize sweaters she knitted
herself, smoked a lot of pot, et cetera.
And my dad was a real Republican type,
and so when I was born, my mom
wanted to name me Harmony Springs
Young, and my dad wanted to name me
Mary Frances Young." As she talked,
she bobbed her head back and forth to
the MTV music, even though the song
was the kind of manufactured pop ballad
she professed to hate.
"So instead of naming me Harmony
or Mary, they agreed to let me decide.
So when I was little, they called me
Mary. I mean, they called me sweetie or
whatever, but like on school forms and
stuff, they wrote Mary Young.
And then on my seventh birthday, my
present was that I got to pick my name.
Cool, huh? So I spent the whole day
looking at my dad's globe for a really
cool name. And so my first choice was
Chad, like the country in Africa.
But then my dad said that was a
boy's name, so I picked Alaska."
I wish my parents had let me pick my
name. But they went ahead and picked
the only name firstborn male Halters
have had for a century. "But why
Alaska?" I asked her.
She smiled with the right side of her
mouth. "Well, later, I found out what it
means. It's from an Aleut word, Alyeska.
It means 'that which the sea breaks
against,' and I love that. But at the time, I
just saw Alaska up there.
And it was big, just like I wanted to
be. And it was damn far away from Vine
Station, Alabama, just like I wanted to
be."
I laughed. "And now you're all
grown up and fairly far away from
home," I said, smiling. "So
congratulations."
She stopped the head bobbing and let
go of my (unfortunately sweaty) hand.
"Getting out isn't that easy," she said
seriously, her eyes on mine like I knew
the way out and wouldn't tell her.
And then she seemed to switch
conversational horses in midstream.
"Like after college, know what I want to
do?
Teach disabled kids. I'm a good
teacher, right? Shit, if I can teach you
precalc, I can teach anybody. Like
maybe kids with autism."
She talked softly and thoughtfully,
like she was telling me a secret, and I
leaned in toward her, suddenly
overwhelmed with the feeling that we
must kiss, that we ought to kiss right now
on the dusty orange couch with its
cigarette burns and its decades of
collected dust. And I would have: I
would have kept leaning toward her until
it became necessary to tilt my face so as
to miss her ski-slope nose, and I would
have felt the shock of her so-soft lips. I
would have. But then she snapped out of
it.
"No," she said, and I couldn't tell at
first whether she was reading my kissobsessed
mind or responding to herself
out loud. She turned away from me, and
softly, maybe to herself, said, "Jesus, I'm
not going to be one of those people who
sits around talking about what they're
gonna do. I'm just going to do it.
Imagining the future is a kind of
nostalgia."
"Huh?" I asked.
"You spend your whole life stuck in
the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll
escape it one day, and how awesome it
will be, and imagining that future keeps
you going, but you never do it. You just
use the future to escape the present."
I guess that made sense. I had
imagined that life at the Creek would be
a bit more exciting than it was — in
reality, there'd been more homework
than adventure — but if I hadn't
imagined it, I would never have gotten to
the Creek at all.
She turned back to the TV, a
commercial for a car now, and made a
joke about Blue Citrus needing its own
car commercial. Mimicking the deepvoiced
passion of commercial voiceovers,
she said, "It's small, it's slow, and
it's shitty, but it runs. Sometimes. Blue
Citrus: See Your Local Used-Car
Dealer." But I wanted to talk more about
her and Vine Station and the future.
"Sometimes I don't get you," I said.
She didn't even glance at me. She
just smiled toward the television and
said, "You never get me. That's the
whole point."
ninety-nine days
before
I spent most of the next day lying in
bed, immersed in the miserably
uninteresting fictional world of Ethan
Frome, while the Colonel sat at his
desk, unraveling the secrets of
differential equations or something.
Although we tried to ration our smoke
breaks amid the shower's steam, we ran
out of cigarettes before dark,
necessitating a trip to Alaska's room.
She lay on the floor, holding a book over
her head.
"Let's go smoke," he said.
"You're out of cigarettes, aren't
you?" she asked without looking up.
"Well. Yes."
"Got five bucks?" she asked.
"Nope."
"Pudge?" she asked.
"Yeah, all right." I fished a five out
of my pocket, and Alaska handed me a
pack of twenty Marlboro Lights. I knew
I'd smoke maybe five of them, but so
long as I subsidized the Colonel's
smoking, he couldn't really attack me for
being another rich kid, a Weekday
Warrior who just didn't happen to live in
Birmingham.
We grabbed Takumi and walked
down to the lake, hiding behind a few
trees, laughing. The Colonel blew smoke
rings, and Takumi called them
"pretentious," while Alaska followed the
smoke rings with her fingers, stabbing at
them like a kid trying to pop bubbles.
And then we heard a branch break. It
might have been a deer, but the Colonel
busted out anyway. A voice directly
behind us said, "Don't run, Chipper," and
the Colonel stopped, turned around, and
returned to us sheepishly.
The Eagle walked toward us slowly,
his lips pursed in disgust. He wore a
white shirt and a black tie, like always.
He gave each of us in turn the Look
of Doom.
"Y'all smell like a North Carolina
tobacco field in a wildfire," he said.
We stood silent. I felt
disproportionately terrible, like I had
just been caught fleeing the scene of a
murder.
Would he call my parents?
"I'll see you in Jury tomorrow at
five," he announced, and then walked
away. Alaska crouched down, picked up
the cigarette she had thrown away, and
started smoking again. The Eagle
wheeled around, his sixth sense
detecting Insubordination To Authority
Figures. Alaska dropped the cigarette
and stepped on it. The Eagle shook his
head, and even though he must have been
crazy mad, I swear to God he smiled.
"He loves me," Alaska told me as
we walked back to the dorm circle. "He
loves all y'all, too. He just loves the
school more. That's the thing. He thinks
busting us is good for the school and
good for us. It's the eternal struggle,
Pudge. The Good versus the Naughty."
"You're awfully philosophical for a
girl that just got busted," I told her.
"Sometimes you lose a battle. But
mischief always wins the war."
ninety-eight days
before
One of the unique things about
Culver Creek was the Jury. Every
semester, the faculty elected twelve
students, three from each class, to serve
on the Jury. The Jury meted out
punishment for non expellable offenses,
for everything from staying out past
curfew to smoking. Usually, it was
smoking or being in a girl's room after
seven.
So you went to the Jury, you made
your case, and they punished you. The
Eagle served as the judge, and he had the
right to overturn the Jury's verdict (just
like in the real American court system),
but he almost never did.
I made my way to Classroom 4 right
after my last class — forty minutes
early, just to be safe. I sat in the hall
with my back against the wall and read
my American history textbook (kind of
remedial reading for me, to be honest)
until Alaska showed up and sat down
next to me. She was chewing on her
bottom lip, and I asked whether she was
nervous.
"Well, yeah. Listen, just sit tight and
don't talk," she told me.
"You don't need to be nervous. But
this is the seventh time I've been caught
smoking. I just don't want — whatever.
I don't want to upset my dad."
"Does your mom smoke or
something?" I asked.
"Not anymore," Alaska said. "It's
fine. You'll be fine."
I didn't start to worry until it got to
be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi
were still unaccounted for. The members
of the Jury filed in one by one, walking
past us without any eye contact, which
made me feel worse. I counted all
twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle.
At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi
rounded the corner toward the
classrooms.
I never saw anything like it. Takumi
wore a starched white shirt with a red
tie with a black paisley print; the
Colonel wore his wrinkled pink buttondown
and flamingo tie. They walked in
step, heads up and shoulders back, like
some kind of action-movie heroes.
I heard Alaska sigh. "The Colonel's
doing his Napoleon walk."
"It's all good," the Colonel told me.
"Just don't say anything."
We walked in— two of us wearing
ties, and two of us wearing ratty T-shirts
— and the Eagle banged an honest-toGod
gavel against the podium in front of
him. The Jury sat in a line behind a
rectangular table. At the front of the
room, by the blackboard, were four
chairs. We sat down, and the Colonel
explained exactly what happened.
"Alaska and I were smoking down
by the lake. We usually go off campus,
but we forgot. We're sorry. It won't
happen again."
I didn't know what was going on. But
I knew my job: sit tight and shut up. One
of the kids looked at Takumi and asked,
"What about you and Halter?"
"We were keeping them company,"
Takumi said calmly.
The kid turned to the Eagle then and
asked, "Did you see anyone smoking?"
"I only saw Alaska, but Chip ran
away, which struck me as cowardly, as
does Miles and Takumi's aw-shucks
routine," the Eagle said, giving me the
Look of Doom. I didn't want to look
guilty, but I couldn't hold his stare, so I
just looked down at my hands.
The Colonel gritted his teeth, like it
pained him to lie. "It is the truth, sir."
The Eagle asked if any of us wanted
to say anything, and then asked if there
were any more questions, and then sent
us outside.
"What the hell was that?" I asked
Takumi when we got outside.
"Just sit tight, Pudge."
Why have Alaska confess when
she'd already been in trouble so many
times? Why the Colonel, who literally
couldn't afford to get in serious trouble?
Why not me? I'd never been busted for
anything. I had the least to lose.
After a couple minutes, the Eagle
came out and motioned for us to come
back inside.
"Alaska and Chip," a member of the
Jury said, "you get ten work hours —
doing dishes in the cafeteria — and
you're both officially one problem away
from a phone call home. Takumi and
Miles, there's nothing in the rules about
watching someone smoke, but the Jury
will remember your story if you break
the rules again. Fair?"
"Fair," Alaska said quickly,
obviously relieved. On my way out, the
Eagle spun me around. "Don't abuse your
privileges at this school, young man, or
you will regret it." I nodded.
eighty-nine days
before
"We found you a girlfriend," Alaska
said to me. Still, no one had explained to
me what happened the week before with
the Jury. It didn't seem to have affected
Alaska, though, who was 1. in our room
after dark with the door closed, and 2.
smoking a cigarette as she sat on the
mostly foam couch. She had stuffed a
towel into the bottom of our door and
insisted it was safe, but I worried —
about the cigarette and the "girlfriend."
"All I have to do now," she said, "is
convince you to like her and convince
her to like you."
"Monumental tasks," the Colonel
pointed out. He lay on the top bunk,
reading for his English class. MobyDick.
"How can you read and talk at the
same time?" I asked.
"Well, I usually can't, but neither the
book nor the conversation is particularly
intellectually challenging."
"I like that book," Alaska said.
"Yes." The Colonel smiled and
leaned over to look at her from his top
bunk. "You would. Big white whale is a
metaphor for everything. You live for
pretentious metaphors."
Alaska was unfazed. "So, Pudge,
what's your feeling on the former Soviet
bloc?"
"Urn. I'm in favor of it?"
She flicked the ashes of her cigarette
into my pencil holder. I almost
protested, but why bother. "You know
that girl in our precalc class," Alaska
said, "soft voice, says thees, not this.
Know that girl?"
"Yeah. Lara. She sat on my lap on
the way to McDonald's."
"Right. I know. And she liked you.
You thought she was quietly discussing
precalc, when she was clearly talking
about having hot sex with you. Which is
why you need me."
"She has great breasts," the Colonel
said without looking up from the whale.
"DO NOT OBJECTIFY WOMEN'S
BODIES!" Alaska shouted.
Now he looked up. "Sorry. Perky
breasts."
"That's not any better!"
"Sure it is," he said. "Great is a
judgment on a woman's body. Perky is
merely an observation. They are perky. I
mean, Christ."
"You're hopeless," she said. "So she
thinks you're cute, Pudge."
"Nice."
"Doesn't mean anything. Problem
with you is that if you talk to her you'll
"uh um uh' your way to disaster."
"Don't be so hard on him," the
Colonel interrupted, as if he was my
mom. "God, I understand whale
anatomy.
Can we move on now, Herman?"
"So Jake is going to be in
Birmingham this weekend, and we're
going on a triple date. Well, triple and a
half, since Takumi will be there, too.
Very low pressure. You won't be able to
screw up, because I'll be there the whole
time."
"Okay."
"Who's my date?" the Colonel asked.
"Your girlfriend is your date."
"All right," he said, and then
deadpanned, "but we don't get along
very well."
"So Friday? Do you have plans for
Friday?" And then I laughed, because the
Colonel and I didn't have plans for this
Friday, or for any other Friday for the
rest of our lives.
"I didn't think so." She smiled.
"Now, we gotta go do dishes in the
cafeteria, Chipper. God, the sacrifices I
make."
eighty-seven days
before
Our triple-and-a-half date started off
well enough. I was in Alaska's room —
for the sake of getting me a girlfriend,
she'd agreed to iron a green button-down
shirt for me — when Jake showed up.
With blond hair to his shoulders, dark
stubble on his cheeks, and the kind of
faux-ruggedness that gets you a career as
a catalog model, Jake was every bit as
good-looking and you'd expect Alaska's
boyfriend to be. She jumped onto him
and wrapped her legs around him (God
forbid anyone ever does that to me, I
thought. Ill fall over). I'd heard Alaska
talk about kissing, but I'd never seen her
kiss until then: As he held her by her
waist, she leaned forward, her pouty lips
parted, her head just slightly tilted, and
enveloped his mouth with such passion
that I felt I should look away but
couldn't. A good while later, she
untangled herself from Jake and
introduced me.
"This is Pudge," she said. Jake and I
shook hands.
"I've heard a lot about ya." He spoke
with a slight Southern accent, one of the
few I'd heard outside of McDonald's. "I
hope your date works out tonight, 'cause
I wouldn't want you stealin' Alaska out
from under me."
"God, you're so adorable," Alaska
said before I could answer, kissing him
again. "I'm sorry." She laughed. "I just
can't seem to stop kissing my boyfriend."
I put on my freshly starched green
shirt, and the three of us gathered up the
Colonel, Sara, Lara, and Takumi and
then walked to the gym to watch the
Culver Creek Nothings take on Harsden
Academy, a private day school in
Mountain Brook, Birmingham's richest
suburb. The Colonel's hatred for
Harsden burned with the fire of a
thousand suns. "The only thing I hate
more than rich people," he told me as we
walked to the gym, "is stupid people.
And all the kids at Harsden are rich, and
they're all too stupid to get into the
Creek."
Since we were supposed to be on a
date and all, I thought I'd sit next to Lara
at the game, but as I tried to walk past a
seated Alaska on my way to Lara,
Alaska shot me a look and patted the
empty spot next to her on the bleachers.
"I'm not allowed to sit next to my
date?" I asked.
"Pudge, one of us has been a girl her
whole life. The other of us has never
gotten to second base. If I were you, I'd
sit down, look cute, and be your
pleasantly aloof self."
"Okay. Whatever you say."
Jake said, "That's pretty much my
strategy for pleasing Alaska."
"Aww," she said, "so sweet! Pudge,
did I tell you that Jake is recording an
album with his band? They're fantastic.
They're like Radiohead meets the
Flaming Lips. Did I tell you that I came
up with their name, Hickman Territory?"
And then, realizing she was being silly:
"Did I tell you that Jake is hung like a
horse and a beautiful, sensual lover?"
"Baby, Jesus." Jake smiled. "Not in
front of the kids."
I wanted to hate Jake, of course, but
as I watched them together, smiling and
fumbling all over each other, I didn't
hate him. I wanted to be him, sure, but I
tried to remember I was ostensibly on a
date with someone else.
Harsden Academy's star player was
a six-foot-seven Goliath named Travis
Eastman that everyone — even his
mother, I suspect — called the Beast.
The first time the Beast got to the freethrow
line, the Colonel could not keep
himself from swearing while he taunted:
"You owe everything to your daddy, you
stupid redneck bastard."
The Beast turned around and glared,
and the Colonel almost got kicked out
after the first free throw, but he smiled at
the ref and said, "Sorry!"
"I want to stay around for a good
part of this one," he said to me.
At the start of the second half, with
the Creek down by a surprisingly slim
margin of twenty-four points and the
Beast at the foul line, the Colonel looked
at Takumi and said, "It's time." Takumi
and the Colonel stood up as the crowd
went, "Shhh…"
"I don't know if this is the best time
to tell you this," the Colonel shouted at
the Beast, "but Takumi here hooked up
with your girlfriend just before the
game."
That made everyone laugh — except
the Beast, who turned from the free
throw line and walked calmly, with the
ball, toward us.
"I think we run now," Takumi said.
"I haven't gotten kicked out," the
Colonel answered.
"Later," Takumi said.
I don't know whether it was the
general anxiety of being on a date (albeit
one with my would-be date sitting five
people away from me) or the specific
anxiety of having the Beast stare in my
direction, but for some reason, I took off
running after Takumi. I thought we were
in the clear as we began to round the
corner of the bleachers, but then I saw,
out of the corner of my eye, a cylindrical
orange object getting bigger and bigger,
like a fast-approaching sun.
I thought: I think that is going to hit
me.
I thought: J should duck.
But in the time between when
something gets thought and when it gets
done, the ball hit me square across the
side of the face. I fell, the back of my
head slamming against the gym floor. I
then stood up immediately, as if unhurt,
and left the gym.
Pride had gotten me off the floor of
the gym, but as soon as I was outside, I
sat down.
"I am concussed," I announced,
entirely sure of my self-diagnosis.
"You're fine," Takumi said as he
jogged back toward me. "Let's get out of
here before we're killed."
"I'm sorry," I said. "But I can't get
up. I have suffered a mild concussion."
Lara ran out and sat down next to
me.
"Are you okay?"
"I am concussed," I said.
Takumi sat down with me and
looked me in the eye. "Do you know
what happened to you?"
"The Beast got me."
"Do you know where you are?"
"I'm on a triple-and-a-half date."
"You're fine," Takumi said. "Let's
go."
And then I leaned forward and threw
up onto Lara's pants. I can't say why I
didn't lean backward or to the side. I
leaned forward and aimed my mouth
toward her jeans — a nice, buttflattering
pair of jeans, the kind of pants
a girl wears when she wants to look nice
but not look like she is trying to look
nice — and I threw up all over them.
Mostly peanut butter, but also clearly
some corn.
"Oh!" she said, surprised and
slightly horrified.
"Oh God," I said. "I'm so sorry."
"I think you might have a
concussion," Takumi said, as if the idea
had never been suggested.
"I am suffering from the nausea and
dizziness typically associated with a
mild concussion," I recited. While
Takumi went to get the Eagle and Lara
changed pants, I lay on the concrete
sidewalk. The Eagle came back with the
school nurse, who diagnosed me with —
get this — a concussion, and then
Takumi drove me to the hospital with
Lara riding shotgun. Apparently I lay in
the back and slowly repeated the words
"The. Symptoms. Generally. Associated.
With. Concussion."
So I spent my date at the hospital
with Lara and Takumi. The doctor told
me to go home and sleep a lot, but to
make sure and have someone wake me
up every four hours or so.
I vaguely remember Lara standing in
the doorway, the room dark and the
outside dark and everything mild and
comfortable but sort of spinny, the world
pulsing as if from a heavy bass beat.
And I vaguely remember Lara smiling at
me from the doorway, the glittering
ambiguity of a girl's smile, which seems
to promise an answer to the question but
never gives it. The question, the one
we've all been asking since girls
stopped being gross, the question that is
too simple to be uncomplicated: Does
she like me or like me? And then I fell
deeply, endlessly asleep and slept until
three in the morning, when the Colonel
woke me up.
"She dumped me," he said.
"I am concussed," I responded.
"So I heard. Hence my waking you
up. Video game?"
"Okay. But keep it on mute. My head
hurts."
"Yeah. Heard you puked on Lara.
Very suave."
"Dumped?" I asked, getting up.
"Yeah. Sara told Jake that I had a
hard-on for Alaska. Those words. In that
order. And I was like, 'Well, I don't have
a hard-on for anything at this moment.
You can check if you'd like,' and Sara
thought I was being too glib, I suppose,
because then she said she knew for a fact
I'd hooked up with Alaska. Which,
incidentally, is ridiculous. I.
Don't. Cheat," he said, and finally the
game finished loading and I half listened
as I drove a stock car in circles around a
silent track in Talladega. The circles
nauseated me, but I kept at it.
"So Alaska went ballistic,
basically." He affected Alaska's voice
then, making it more shrill and
headache-inducing than it actually was.
"'No woman should ever lie about
another woman! You've violated the
sacred covenant between women! How
will stabbing one another in the back
help women to rise above patriarchal
oppression?!' And so on. And then Jake
came to Alaska's defense, saying that she
would never cheat because she loved
him, and then I was like, 'Don't worry
about Sara. She just likes bullying
people.' And then Sara asked me why I
never stood up for her, and somewhere
in there I called her a crazy bitch, which
didn't go over particularly well. And
then the waitress asked us to leave, and
so we were standing in the parking lot
and she said, 'I've had enough,' and I just
stared at her and she said, 'Our
relationship is over.'" He stopped
talking then. "'Our relationship is over?'"
I repeated. I felt very spacey and thought
it was just best to repeat the last phrase
of whatever the Colonel said so he could
keep talking.
"Yeah. So that's it. You know what's
lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I
mean, we were hopeless. Badly
matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved
her. I lost my virginity to her."
"You lost your virginity to her?"
"Yeah. Yeah. I never told you that?
She's the only girl I've slept with. I don't
know. Even though we fought, like,
ninety-four percent of the time, I'm really
sad."
"You're really sad?"
"Sadder than I thought I'd be,
anyway. I mean, I knew it was
inevitable. We haven't had a pleasant
moment this whole year. Ever since I got
here, I mean, we were just on each other
relentlessly. I should have been nicer to
her.
I don't know. It's sad."
"It is sad," I repeated.
"I mean, it's stupid to miss someone
you didn't even get along with. But, I
don't know, it was nice, you know,
having someone you could always fight
with."
"Fighting," I said, and then,
confused, barely able to drive, I added,
"is nice."
"Right. I don't know what I'll do
now. I mean, it was nice to have her. I'm
a mad guy, Pudge. What do I do with
that?"
"You can fight with me," I said. I put
my controller down and leaned back on
our foam couch and was asleep. As I
drifted off, I heard the Colonel say, "I
can't be mad at you, you harmless skinny
bastard."
eighty-four days
before
Three days later,the rain began. My
head still hurt, and the sizable knot
above my left temple looked, the
Colonel thought, like a miniaturized
topographical map of Macedonia, which
I had not previously known was a place,
let alone a country. And as the Colonel
and I walked over the parched, half-
dead grass that Monday, I said, "I
suppose we could use some rain," and
the Colonel looked up at the low clouds
coming in fast and threatening, and then
he said, "Well, use it or not, we're sure
as shit going to get some."
And we sure as shit did. Twenty
minutes into French class, Madame
O'Malley was conjugating the verb to
believe in the subjunctive. Que je croie.
Que tu croies. Qu'il ou qu'elle croie.
She said it over and over, like it wasn't a
verb so much as a Buddhist mantra. Que
je croie; que tu croies; qu'il ou qu'elle
croie. What a funny thing to say over and
over again: I would believe; you would
believe; he or she would believe.
Believe what? I thought, and right then,
the rain came.
It came all at once and in a furious
torrent, like God was mad and wanted to
flood us out. Day after day, night after
night, it rained. It rained so that I
couldn't see across the dorm circle, so
that the lake swelled up and lapped
against the Adirondack swing,
swallowing half of the fake beach. By
the third day, I abandoned my umbrella
entirely and walked around in a
perpetual state of wetness. Everything at
the cafeteria tasted like the minor acid of
rainwater and everything stank of
mildew and showers became ludicrously
inappropriate because the whole
goddamned world had better water
pressure than the showers.
And the rain made hermits of us all.
The Colonel spent every not-in-class
moment sitting on the couch, reading the
almanac and playing video games, and I
wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk or
whether he just wanted to sit on the
white foam and drink his ambrosia in
peace.
After the disaster that was our
"date," I felt it best not to speak to Lara
under any circumstances, lest I suffer a
concussion and/or an attack of puking,
even though she'd told me in precalc the
next day that it was "no beeg deal."
And I saw Alaska only in class and
could never talk to her, because she
came to every class late and left the
moment the bell rang, before I could
even cap my pen and close my notebook.
On the fifth evening of the rain, I walked
into the cafeteria fully prepared to go
back to my room and eat a reheated
bufriedo for dinner if Alaska and/or
Takumi weren't eating (I knew full well
the Colonel was in Room 43, dining on
milk 'n' vodka). But I stayed, because I
saw Alaska sitting alone, her back to a
rain-streaked window. I grabbed a
heaping plate of fried okra and sat down
next to her.
"God, it's like it'll never end," I said,
referring to the rain.
"Indeed," she said. Her wet hair
hung from her head and mostly covered
her face. I ate some. She ate some.
"How've you been?" I finally asked.
"I'm really not up for answering any
questions that start with how, when,
where, why, or what."
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"That's a what. I'm not doing what's
right now. All right, I should go." She
pursed her lips and exhaled slowly, like
the way the Colonel blew out smoke.
"What—"Then I stopped myself and
reworded. "Did I do something?" I
asked.
She gathered her tray and stood up
before answering. "Of course not,
sweetie."
Her "sweetie" felt condescending,
not romantic, like a boy enduring his
first biblical rainstorm couldn't possibly
understand her problems — whatever
they were. It took a sincere effort not to
roll my eyes at her, though she wouldn't
have even noticed as she walked out of
the cafeteria with her hair dripping over
her face.
seventy-six days
before
"I feel better,"the Colonel told me on
the ninth day of the rainstorm as he sat
down next to me in religion class. "I had
an epiphany. Do you remember that night
when she came to the room and was a
complete and total bitch?"
"Yeah. The opera. The flamingo tie."
"Right."
"What about it?" I asked.
The Colonel pulled out a spiral
notebook, the top half of which was
soaking wet, and slowly pulled the
pages apart until he found his place.
"That was the epiphany. She's a
complete and total bitch."
Hyde hobbled in, leaning heavily on
a black cane. As he made his way
toward his chair, he drily noted, "My
trick knee is warning me that we might
have some rain. So prepare yourselves."
He stood in front of his chair, leaned
back cautiously, grabbed it with both
hands, and collapsed into the chair with
a series of quick, shallow breaths —
like a woman in labor.
"Although it isn't due for more than
two months, you'll be receiving your
paper topic for this semester today.
Now, I'm quite sure that you've all
read the syllabus for this class with such
frequency and seriousness that by now
you've committed it to memory." He
smirked. "But a reminder: This paper is
fifty percent of your grade. I encourage
you to take it seriously. Now, about this
Jesus fellow."
Hyde talked about the Gospel of
Mark, which I hadn't read until the day
before, although I was a Christian. I
guess. I'd been to church, uh, like four
times. Which is more frequently than I'd
been to a mosque or a synagogue.
He told us that in the first century,
around the time of Jesus, some of the
Roman coins had a picture of the
Emperor Augustus on them, and that
beneath his picture were inscribed the
words Filius Dei. The Son of God.
"We are speaking," he said, "of a
time in which gods had sons. It was not
so unusual to be a son of God. The
miracle, at least in that time and in that
place, was that Jesus — a peasant, a
Jew, a nobody in an empire ruled
exclusively by somebodies — was the
son of that God, the all-powerful God of
Abraham and Moses. That God's son
was not an emperor. Not even a trained
rabbi. A peasant and a Jew. A nobody
like you. While the Buddha was special
because he abandoned his wealth and
noble birth to seek enlightenment, Jesus
was special because he lacked wealth
and noble birth, but inherited the
ultimate nobility: King of Kings. Class
over. You can pick up a copy of your
final exam on the way out. Stay dry." It
wasn't until I stood up to leave that I
noticed Alaska had skipped class —
how could she skip the only class worth
attending? I grabbed a copy of the final
for her.
The final exam: What is the most
important question human beings must
answer? Choose your question wisely,
and then examine how Islam,
Buddhism, and Christianity attempt to
answer it "I hope that poor bastard lives
the rest of the school year," the Colonel
said as we jogged home through the rain,
"because I'm sure starting to enjoy that
class. What's your most important
question?"
After thirty seconds of running, I was
already winded. "What happens…to
us…when we die?"
"Christ, Pudge, if you don't stop
running, you're going to find out." He
slowed to a walk. "My question is: Why
do good people get rotten lots in life?
Holy shit, is that Alaska?"
She was running at us at full speed,
and she was screaming, but I couldn't
hear her over the pounding rain until she
was so close to us that I could see her
spit flying.
"The fuckers flooded my room. They
ruined like a hundred of my books!
Goddamned pissant Weekday Warrior
shit. Colonel, they poked a hole in the
gutter and connected a plastic tube from
the gutter down through my back
window into my room! The whole place
is soaking wet. My copy of The General
in His Labyrinth is absolutely ruined."
"That's pretty good," the Colonel
said, like an artist admiring another's
work.
"Hey!" she shouted.
"Sorry. Don't worry, dude," he said.
"God will punish the wicked. And
before He does, we will."
sixty-seven days
before
So this I show no ah felt.You wake
up one morning and God has forgiven
you and you walk around squinting all
day because you've forgotten how
sunlight feels warm and rough against
your skin like a kiss on the cheek from
your dad, and the whole world is
brighter and cleaner than ever before,
like central Alabama has been put in the
washing machine for two weeks and
cleaned with extra-superstrength
detergent with color brightener, and now
the grass is greener and the bufriedos are
crunchier.
I stayed by the classrooms that
afternoon, lying on my stomach in the
newly dry grass and reading for
American history — the Civil War, or as
it was known around these parts, the
War Between the States. To me, it was
the war that spawned a thousand good
last words. Like General Albert Sidney
Johnston, who, when asked if he was
injured, answered, "Yes, and I fear
seriously." Or Robert E. Lee, who, many
years after the war, in a dying delirium,
announced, "Strike the tent!"
I was mulling over why the
Confederate generals had better last
words than the Union ones (Ulysses S.
Grant's last word, "Water," was pretty
lame) when I noticed a shadow blocking
me from the sun. It had been some time
since I'd seen a shadow, and it startled
me a bit. I looked up.
"I brought you a snack," Takumi
said, dropping an oatmeal cream pie
onto my book.
"Very nutritious." I smiled.
"You've got your oats. You've got
your meal. You've got your cream. It's a
fuckin' food pyramid."
"Hell yeah it is."
And then I didn't know what to say.
Takumi knew a lot about hiphop; I knew
a lot about last words and video games.
Finally, I said, "I can't believe those
guys flooded Alaska's room."
"Yeah," Takumi said, not looking at
me. "Well, they had their reasons. You
have to understand that with like
everybody, even the Weekday Warriors,
Alaska is famous for pranking. I mean,
last year, we put a Volkswagen Beetle in
the library. So if they have a reason to
try and one-up her, they'll try. And that's
pretty ingenious, to divert water from the
gutter to her room. I mean, I don't want
to admire it…"
I laughed. "Yeah. That will be tough
to top." I unwrapped the cream pie and
bit into it. Mmm…hundreds of delicious
calories per bite.
"She'll think of something," he said.
"Pudge," he said. "Hmm. Pudge, you
need a cigarette. Let's go for a walk."
I felt nervous, as I invariably do
when someone says my name twice with
a hmm in between. But I got up, leaving
my books behind, and walked toward the
Smoking Hole. But as soon as we got to
the edge of the woods, Takumi turned
away from the dirt road. "Not sure the
Hole is safe," he said. Not safe? I
thought. It's the safest place to smoke a
cigarette in the known universe. But I
just followed him through the thick
brush, weaving through pine trees and
threatening, chest-high brambly bushes.
After a while, he just sat down. I cupped
my hand around my lighter to protect the
flame from the slight breeze and lit up.
"Alaska ratted out Marya," he said.
"So the Eagle might know about the
Smoking Hole, too. I don't know. I've
never seen him down that way, but who
knows what she told him."
"Wait, how do you know?" I asked,
dubious.
"Well, for one thing, I figured it out.
And for another, Alaska admitted it. She
told me at least part of the truth, that
right at the end of school last year, she
tried to sneak off campus one night after
lights-out to go visit Jake and then got
busted. She said she was careful — no
headlights or anything — but the Eagle
caught her, and she had a bottle of wine
in her car, so she was fucked. And the
Eagle took her into his house and gave
her the same offer he gives to everyone
when they get fatally busted. 'Either tell
me everything you know or go to your
room and pack up your stuff.' So Alaska
broke and told him that Marya and Paul
were drunk and in her room right then.
And then she told him God knows
what else. And so the Eagle let her go,
because he needs rats to do his job. She
was smart, really, to rat on one of her
friends, because no one ever thinks to
blame the friends. That's why the
Colonel is so sure it was Kevin and his
boys. I didn't believe it could be Alaska,
either, until I figured out that she was the
only person on campus who could've
known what Marya was doing. I
suspected Paul's roommate, Longwell —
one of the guys who pulled the armlessmermaid
bit on you. Turns out he was at
home that night. His aunt had died. I
checked the obit in the paper. Hollis
Burnis Chase — hell of a name for a
woman."
"So the Colonel doesn't know?" I
asked, stunned. I put out my cigarette,
even though I wasn't quite finished,
because I felt spooked. I'd never
suspected Alaska could be disloyal.
Moody, yes. But not a rat.
"No, and he can't know, because
he'll go crazy and get her expelled. The
Colonel takes all this honor and loyalty
shit pretty seriously, if you haven't
noticed."
"I've noticed."
Takumi shook his head, his hands
pushing aside leaves to dig into the stillwet
dirt beneath. "I just don't get why
she'd be so afraid of getting expelled. I'd
hate to get expelled, but you have to take
your lumps. I don't get it."
"Well, she obviously doesn't like
home."
"True. She only goes home over
Christmas and the summer, when Jake is
there. But whatever. I don't like home,
either. But I'd never give the Eagle the
satisfaction." Takumi picked up a twig
and dug it into the soft red dirt.
"Listen, Pudge. I don't know what
kind of prank Alaska and the Colonel are
going to come up with to end this, but I'm
sure we'll both be involved. I'm telling
you all this so you can know what you're
getting into, because if you get caught,
you had better take it."
I thought of Florida, of my "school
friends," and realized for the first time
how much I would miss the Creek if I
ever had to leave it. I stared down at
Takumi's twig sticking erect out of the
mud and said, "I swear to God I won't
rat."
I finally understood that day at the
Jury: Alaska wanted to show us that we
could trust her. Survival at Culver Creek
meant loyalty, and she had ignored that.
But then she'd shown me the way. She
and the Colonel had taken the fall for me
to show me how it was done, so I would
know what to do when the time came.
fifty-eight days
before
About a week later I woke up at 6:30
—6:30 on a Saturday! — to the sweet
melody of Decapitation: automatic
gunfire blasted out above the menacing,
bass-heavy background music of the
video game. I rolled over and saw
Alaska pulling the controller up and to
the right, as if that would help her
escape certain death. I had the same bad
habit.
"Can you at least mute it?"
"Pudge,"she said, fauxcondescending,
"the sound is an integral
part of the artistic experience of this
video game.
Muting Decapitation would be like
reading only every other word of Jane
Eyre. The Colonel woke up about half
an hour ago. He seemed a little annoyed,
so I told him to go sleep in my room."
"Maybe I'll join him," I said
groggily.
Rather than answering my question,
she remarked, "So I heard Takumi told
you. Yeah, I ratted out Marya, and I'm
sorry, and I'll never do it again. In other
news, are you staying here for
Thanksgiving? Because I am."
I rolled back toward the wall and
pulled the comforter over my head. I
didn't know whether to trust Alaska, and
I'd certainly had enough of her
unpredictability — cold one day, sweet
the next; irresistibly flirty one moment,
resistibly obnoxious the next. I preferred
the Colonel: At least when he was
cranky, he had a reason.
In a testament to the power of
fatigue, I managed to fall asleep quickly,
convinced that the shrieking of dying
monsters and Alaska's delighted squeals
upon killing them were nothing more
than a pleasant sound track by which to
dream. I woke up half an hour later,
when she sat down on my bed, her butt
against my hip. Her underwear, her
jeans, the comforter, my corduroys, and
my boxers between us, I thought. Five
layers, and yet I felt it, the nervous
warmth of touching — a pale reflection
of the fireworks of one mouth on
another, but a reflection nonetheless.
And in the almost-ness of the moment, I
cared at least enough. I wasn't sure
whether I liked her, and I doubted
whether I could trust her, but I cared at
least enough to try to find out. Her on my
bed, wide green eyes staring down at
me. The enduring mystery of her sly,
almost smirking, smile. Five layers
between us.
She continued as if I hadn't been
asleep. "Jake has to study. So he doesn't
want me in Nashville. Says he can't pay
attention to musicology while staring at
me. I said I would wear a burka, but he
wasn't convinced, so I'm staying here."
"I'm sorry," I said.
"Oh, don't be. I'll have loads to do.
There's a prank to plan. But I was
thinking you should stay here, too. In
fact, I have composed a list."
"A list?"
She reached into her pocket and
pulled out a heavily folded piece of
notebook paper and began to read.
"Why Pudge Should Stay at the
Creek for Thanksgiving: A List,by
Alaska Young.
"One. Because he is a very
conscientious student, Pudge has been
deprived of many wonderful Culver
Creek experiences, including but not
limited to A. drinking wine with me in
the woods, and B. getting up early on a
Saturday to eat breakfast at Mclnedible
and then driving through the greater
Birmingham area smoking cigarettes and
talking about how pathetically boring the
greater Birmingham area is, and also C.
going out late at night and lying in the
dewy soccer field and reading a Kurt
Vonnegut book by moonlight.
"Two. Although she certainly does
not excel at endeavors such as teaching
the French language, Madame O'Malley
makes a mean stuffing, and she invites
all the students who stay on campus to
Thanksgiving dinner.
Which is usually just me and the
South Korean exchange student, but
whatever. Pudge would be welcome.
"Three. I don't really have a Three,
but One and Two were awfully good."
One and Two appealed to me,
certainly, but mostly I liked the idea of
just her and just me on campus. "I'll talk
to my parents. Once they wake up," I
said. She coaxed me onto the couch, and
we played Decapitation together until
she abruptly dropped the controller.
"I'm not flirting. I'm just tired," she
said, kicking off her flip-flops. She
pulled her feet onto the foam couch,
tucking them behind a cushion, and
scooted up to put her head in my lap. My
corduroys. My boxers. Two layers. I
could feel the warmth of her cheek on
my thigh.
There are times when it is
appropriate, even preferable, to get an
erection when someone's face is in close
proximity to your penis.
This was not one of those times.
So I stopped thinking about the
layers and the warmth, muted the TV,
and focused on Decapitation.
At 8:30, I turned off the game and
scooted out from underneath Alaska. She
turned onto her back, still asleep, the
lines of my corduroy pants imprinted on
her cheek.
I usually only called my parents on
Sunday afternoons, so when my mom
heard my voice, she instantly
overreacted. "What's wrong, Miles? Are
you okay?"
"I'm fine, Mom. I think — if it's okay
with you, I think I might stay here for
Thanksgiving. A lot of my friends are
staying" — lie—"and I have a lot of
work to do" — double lie. "I had no
idea how hard the classes would be,
Mom" truth.
"Oh, sweetie. We miss you so much.
And there's a big Thanksgiving turkey
waiting for you. And all the cranberry
sauce you can eat."
I hated cranberry sauce, but for some
reason my mom persisted in her lifelong
belief that it was my very favorite food,
even though every single Thanksgiving I
politely declined to include it on my
plate.
"I know, Mom. I miss you guys, too.
But I really want to do well here" —
truth—"and plus it's really nice to have,
like, friends" — truth.
I knew that playing the friend card
would sell her on the idea, and it did. So
I got her blessing to stay on campus after
promising to hang out with them for
every minute of Christmas break (as if I
had other plans).
I spent the morning at the computer,
flipping back and forth between my
religion and English papers. There were
only two weeks of classes before exams
— the coming one and the one after
Thanksgiving — and so far, the best
personal answer I had to "What happens
to people after they die?" was "Well,
something. Maybe."
The Colonel came in at noon, his
thick ubermath book cradled in his arms.
"I just saw Sara," he said.
"How'd that work out for ya?"
"Bad. She said she still loved me.
God, 'I love you' really is the gateway
drug of breaking up. Saying' I love you'
while walking across the dorm circle
inevitably leads to saying 'I love you'
while you're doing it. So I just bolted." I
laughed. He pulled out a notebook and
sat down at his desk.
"Yeah. Ha-ha. So Alaska said you're
staying here."
"Yeah. I feel a little guilty about
ditching my parents, though."
"Yeah, well. If you're staying here in
hopes of making out with Alaska, I sure
wish you wouldn't. If you unmoor her
from the rock that is Jake, God have
mercy on us all. That would be some
drama, indeed. And as a rule, I like to
avoid drama."
"It's not because I want to make out
with her."
"Hold on." He grabbed a pencil and
scrawled excitedly at the paper as if he'd
just made a mathematical breakthrough
and then looked back up at me. "I just
did some calculations, and I've been
able to determine that you're full of shit."
And he was right. How could I
abandon my parents, who were nice
enough to pay for my education at Culver
Creek, my parents who had always
loved me, just because I maybe liked
some girl with a boyfriend? How could I
leave them alone with a giant turkey and
mounds of inedible cranberry sauce? So
during third period, I called my mom at
work. I wanted her to say it was okay, I
guess, for me to stay at the Creek for
Thanksgiving, but I didn't quite expect
her to excitedly tell me that she and Dad
had bought plane tickets to England
immediately after I called and were
planning to spend Thanksgiving in a
castle on their second honeymoon.
"Oh, that — that's awesome," I said,
and then quickly got off the phone
because I did not want her to hear me
cry.
I guess Alaska heard me slam down
the phone from her room, because she
opened the door as I turned away, but
said nothing. I walked across the dorm
circle, and then straight through the
soccer field, bushwhacking through the
woods, until I ended up on the banks of
Culver Creek just down from the bridge.
I sat with my butt on a rock and my feet
in the dark dirt of the creek bed and
tossed pebbles into the clear, shallow
water, and they landed with an empty
plop, barely audible over the rumbling
of the creek as it danced its way south.
The light filtered through the leaves and
pine needles above as if through lace,
the ground spotted in shadow.
I thought of the one thing about home
that I missed, my dad's study with its
built-in, floor-to-ceiling shelves sagging
with thick biographies, and the black
leather chair that kept me just
uncomfortable enough to keep from
feeling sleepy as I read. It was stupid, to
feel as upset as I did. I ditched them, but
it felt the other way around.
Still, I felt unmistakably homesick.
I looked up toward the bridge and
saw Alaska sitting on one of the blue
chairs at the Smoking Hole, and though
I'd thought I wanted to be alone, I found
myself saying, "Hey." Then, when she
did not turn to me, I screamed, "Alaska!"
She walked over.
"I was looking for you," she said,
joining me on the rock.
"Hey."
"I'm really sorry, Pudge," she said,
and put her arms around me, resting her
head against my shoulder. It occurred to
me that she didn't even know what had
happened, but she still sounded sincere.
"What am I going to do?"
"You'll spend Thanksgiving with me,
silly. Here."
"So why don't you go home for
vacations?" I asked her.
"I'm just scared of ghosts, Pudge.
And home is full of them."
fifty-two days
before
After everyone left;after the
Colonel's mom showed up in a beat-up
hatchback and he threw his giant duffel
bag into the backseat; and after he said,
"I'm not much for saying good-bye. I'll
see you in a week. Don't do anything I
wouldn't do"; and after a green
limousine arrived for Lara, whose father
was the only doctor in some small town
in southern Alabama; and after I joined
Alaska on a harrowing, we-don't-needno-stinking-brakes
drive to the airport to
drop off Takumi; and after the campus
settled into an eerie quiet, with no doors
slamming and no music playing and no
one laughing and no one screaming; after
all that: We made our way down to the
soccer field, and she took me to edge of
the field where the woods start, the same
steps I'd walked on my way to being
thrown into the lake. Beneath the full
moon she cast a shadow, and you could
see the curve from her waist to her hips
in the shadow, and after a while she
stopped and said, "Dig."
And I said, "Dig?" and she said,
"Dig," and we went on like that for a bit,
and then I got on my knees and dug
through the soft black dirt at the edge of
the woods, and before I could get very
far, my fingers scratched glass, and I dug
around the glass until I pulled out a
bottle of pink wine — Strawberry Hill,
it was called, I suppose because if it had
not tasted like vinegar with a dash of
maple syrup, it might have tasted like
strawberries.
"I have a fake ID," she said, "but it
sucks. So every time I go to the liquor
store, I try to buy ten bottles of this, and
some vodka for the Colonel. And so
when it finally works, I'm covered for a
semester. And then I give the Colonel his
vodka, and he puts it wherever he puts it,
and I take mine and bury it."
"Because you're a pirate," I said.
"Aye, matey. Precisely. Although
wine consumption has risen a bit this
semester, so we'll need to take a trip
tomorrow. This is the last bottle." She
unscrewed the cap — no corks here —
sipped, and handed it to me. "Don't
worry about the Eagle tonight," she said.
"He's just happy most everyone's
gone. He's probably masturbating for the
first time in a month."
I worried about it for a moment as I
held the bottle by the neck, but I wanted
to trust her, and so I did. I took a minor
sip, and as soon as I swallowed, I felt
my body rejecting the stinging syrup of
it. It washed back up my esophagus, but I
swallowed hard, and there, yes, I did it.
I was drinking on campus.
So we lay in the tall grass between
the soccer field and the woods, passing
the bottle back and forth and tilting our
heads up to sip the wince-inducing wine.
As promised in the list, she brought a
Kurt Vonnegut book, Cat's Cradle, and
she read aloud to me, her soft voice
mingling with the the frogs' croaking and
the grasshoppers landing softly around
us. I did not hear her words so much as
the cadence of her voice. She'd
obviously read the book many times
before, and so she read flawlessly and
confidently, and I could hear her smile in
the reading of it, and the sound of that
smile made me think that maybe I would
like novels better if Alaska Young read
them to me. After a while, she put down
the book, and I felt warm but not drunk
with the bottle resting between us — my
chest touching the bottle and her chest
touching the bottle but us not touching
each other, and then she placed her hand
on my leg.
Her hand just above my knee, the
palm flat and soft against my jeans and
her index finger making slow, lazy
circles that crept toward the inside of my
thigh, and with one layer between us,
God I wanted her. And lying there, amid
the tall, still grass and beneath the stardrunk
sky, listening to the just-this-sideof-inaudible
sound of her rhythmic
breathing and the noisy silence of the
bullfrogs, the grasshoppers, the distant
cars rushing endlessly on 1-65, I thought
it might be a fine time to say the Three
Little Words. And I steeled myself to say
them as I stared up at that starriest night,
convinced myself that she felt it, too, that
her hand so alive and vivid against my
leg was more than playful, and fuck Lara
and fuck Jake because I do, Alaska
Young, I do love you and what else
matters but that and my lips parted to
speak and before I could even begin to
breathe out the words, she said, "It's not
life or death, the labyrinth."
"Urn, okay. So what is it?"
"Suffering," she said. "Doing wrong
and having wrong things happen to you.
That's the problem. Bolivar was talking
about the pain, not about the living or
dying. How do you get out of the
labyrinth of suffering?"
"What's wrong?" I asked. And I felt
the absence of her hand on me.
"Nothing's wrong. But there's always
suffering, Pudge. Homework or malaria
or having a boyfriend who lives far
away when there's a good-looking boy
lying next to you. Suffering is universal.
It's the one thing Buddhists, Christians,
and Muslims are all worried about."
I turned to her. "Oh, so maybe Dr.
Hyde's class isn't total bullshit." And
both of us lying on our sides, she smiled,
our noses almost touching, my unblinking
eyes on hers, her face blushing from the
wine, and I opened my mouth again but
this time not to speak, and she reached
up and put a finger to my lips and said,
"Shh. Shh. Don't ruin it."
fifty-one days
before
The next morning,I didn't hear the
knocking, if there was any.
I just heard, "UP! Do you know what
time it is?!"
I looked at the clock and groggily
muttered, "It's seven thirty-six."
"No, Pudge. It's party time! We've
only got seven days left before everyone
comes back. Oh God, I can't even tell
you how nice it is to have you here. Last
Thanksgiving, I spent the whole time
constructing one massive candle using
the wax from all my little candles. God,
it was boring. I counted the ceiling tiles.
Sixty-seven down, eighty-four across.
Talk about suffering! Absolute torture."
"I'm really tired. I—" I said, and then
she cut me off.
"Poor Pudge. Oh, poor poor Pudge.
Do you want me to climb into bed with
you and cuddle?"
"Well, if you're offering—" "NO!
UP! NOW!"
She took me behind a wing of
Weekday Warrior rooms—50 to 59—
and stopped in front of a window,
placed her palms flat against it, and
pushed up until the window was half
open, then crawled inside. I followed.
"What do you see, Pudge?"
I saw a dorm room — the same
cinder-block walls, the same
dimensions, even the same layout as my
own. Their couch was nicer, and they
had an actual coffee table instead
ofcoffee table. They had two posters on
the wall. One featured a huge stack of
hundred-dollar bills with the caption the
first million is the hardest. On the
opposite wall, a poster of a red Ferrari.
"Uh, I see a dorm room."
"You're not looking, Pudge. When I
go into your room, I see a couple of guys
who love video games. When I look at
my room, I see a girl who loves books."
She walked over to the couch and picked
up a plastic soda bottle. "Look at this,"
she said, and I saw that it was half filled
with a brackish, brown liquid. Dip spit.
"So they dip. And they obviously aren't
hygienic about it. So are they going to
care if we pee on their toothbrushes?
They won't care enough, that's for sure.
Look. Tell me what these guys love."
"They love money," I said, pointing
to the poster. She threw up her hands,
exasperated.
"They all love money, Pudge. Okay,
go into the bathroom. Tell me what you
see there."
The game was annoying me a little,
but I went into the bathroom as she sat
down on that inviting couch. Inside the
shower, I found a dozen bottles of
shampoo and conditioner. In the
medicine cabinet, I found a cylindrical
bottle of something called Rewind. I
opened it — the bluish gel smelled like
flowers and rubbing alcohol, like a
fancy hair salon. (Under the sink, I also
found a tub of Vaseline so big that it
could have only had one possible use,
which I didn't care to dwell on.) I came
back into the room and excitedly said,
"They love their hair."
"Precisely!" she shouted. "Look on
the top bunk." Perilously positioned on
the thin wooden headboard of the bed, a
bottle of STAWET gel. "Kevin doesn't
just wake up with that spiky bedhead
look, Pudge. He works for it. He loves
that hair. They leave their hair products
here, Pudge, because they have
duplicates at home. All those boys do.
And you know why?"
"Because they're compensating for
their tiny little penises?" I asked.
"Ha ha. No. That's why they're
macho assholes. They love their hair
because they aren't smart enough to love
something more interesting. So we hit
them where it hurts: the scalp."
"Ohh-kaay," I said, unsure of how,
exactly, to prank someone's scalp.
She stood up and walked to the
window and bent over to shimmy out.
"Don't look at my ass," she said, and so I
looked at her ass, spreading out wide
from her thin waist. She effortlessly
somersaulted out the half-opened
window. I took the feet first approach,
and once I got my feet on the ground, I
limboed my upper body out the window.
"Well," she said. "That looked
awkward. Let's go to the Smoking Hole."
She shuffled her feet to kick up dry
orange dirt on the road to the bridge,
seeming not to walk so much as crosscountry
ski. As we followed the almosttrail
down from the bridge to the Hole,
she turned around and looked back at
me, stopping. "I wonder how one would
go about acquiring industrial-strength
blue dye," she said, and then held a tree
branch back for me.
forty-nine days
forty-nine days
before
Two days later — Monday, the first
real day of vacation — I spent the
morning working on my religion final
and went to Alaska's room in the
afternoon. She was reading in bed.
"Auden," she announced. "What
were his last words?"
"Don't know. Never heard of him."
"Never heard of him? You poor,
illiterate boy. Here, read this line." I
walked over and looked down at her
index finger. "You shall love your
crooked neighbour/ With your crooked
heart," I read aloud. "Yeah. That's pretty
good," I said.
"Pretty good? Sure, and bufriedos
are pretty good. Sex is pretty fun. The
sun is pretty hot. Jesus, it says so much
about love and brokenness — it's
perfect."
"Mm-hmm." I nodded
unenthusiastically.
"You're hopeless. Wanna go porn
hunting?"
"Huh?"
"We can't love our neighbors till we
know how crooked their hearts are.
Don't you like porn?" she asked, smiling.
"Urn," I answered. The truth was that
I hadn't seen much porn, but the idea of
looking at porn with Alaska had a
certain appeal.
We started with the 50s wing of
dorms and made our way backward
around the hexagon — she pushed open
the back windows while I looked out
and made sure no one was walking by.
I'd never been in most people's
rooms. After three months, I knew most
people, but I regularly talked to very few
— just the Colonel and Alaska and
Takumi, really. But in a few hours, I got
to know my classmates quite well.
Wilson Carbod, the center for the
Culver Creek Nothings, had
hemorrhoids, or at least he kept
hemorrhoidal cream secreted away in
the bottom drawer of his desk. Chandra
Kilers, a cute girl who loved math a
little too much, and who Alaska
believed was the Colonel's future
girlfriend, collected Cabbage Patch
Kids. I don't mean that she collected
Cabbage Patch Kids when she was, like,
five. She collected them now — dozens
of them — black, white, Latino, and
Asian, boys and girls, babies dressed
like farmhands and budding
businessmen. A senior Weekday
Warrior named Holly Moser sketched
nude self-portraits in charcoal pencil,
portraying her rotund form in all its
girth.
I was stunned by how many people
had booze. Even the Weekday Warriors,
who got to go home every weekend, had
beer and liquor stashed everywhere
from toilet tanks to the bottoms of dirty-
clothes hampers.
"God, I could have ratted out
anyone," Alaska said softly as she
unearthed a forty-ounce bottle of
Magnum malt liquor from Longwell
Chase's closet. I wondered, then, why
she had chosen Paul and Marya.
Alaska found everyone's secrets so
fast that I suspected she'd done this
before, but she couldn't possibly have
had advance knowledge of the secrets of
Ruth and Margot Blowker, ninth-grade
twin sisters who were new and seemed
to socialize even less than I did. After
crawling into their room, Alaska looked
around for a moment, then walked to the
bookshelf. She stared at it, then pulled
out the King James Bible, and there — a
purple bottle of Maui Wowie wine
cooler.
"How clever," she said as she
twisted off the cap. She drank it down in
two long sips, and then proclaimed,
"Maui WOWIE!"
"They'll know you were here!" I
shouted.
Her eyes widened. "Oh no, you're
right, Pudge!" she said.
"Maybe they'll go to the Eagle and
tell him that someone stole their wine
cooler!" She laughed and leaned out the
window, throwing the empty bottle into
the grass.
And we found plenty of porn
magazines haphazardly stuffed in
between mattresses and box springs. It
turns out that Hank Walsten did like
something other than basketball and pot:
he liked Juggs. But we didn't find a
movie until Room 32, occupied by a
couple of guys from Mississippi named
Joe and Marcus. They were in our
religion class and sometimes sat with the
Colonel and me at lunch, but I didn't
know them well.
Alaska read the sticker on the top of
the video. "The Bitches of Madison
County. Well. Ain't that just delightful."
We ran with it to the TV room,
closed the blinds, locked the door, and
watched the movie. It opened with a
woman standing on a bridge with her
legs spread while a guy knelt in front of
her, giving her oral sex. No time for
dialogue, I suppose. By the time they
started doing it, Alaska commenced with
her righteous indignation. "They just
don't make sex look fun for women. The
girl is just an object. Look! Look at
that!"
I was already looking, needless to
say. A woman crouched on her hands
and knees while a guy knelt behind her.
She kept saying "Give it to me" and
moaning, and though her eyes, brown
and blank, betrayed her lack of interest, I
couldn't help but take mental notes.
Hands on her shoulders, I noted. Fast,
but not too fast or it's going to be over,
fast. Keep your grunting to a minimum.
As if reading my mind, she said,
"God, Pudge. Never do it that hard. That
would hurt. That looks like torture.
And all she can do is just sit there
and take it? This is not a man and a
woman. It's a penis and a vagina. What's
erotic about that? Where's the kissing?"
"Given their position, I don't think
they can kiss right now," I noted.
"That's my point. Just by virtue of
how they're doing it, it's objectification.
He can't even see her face! This is what
can happen to women, Pudge. That
woman is someone's daughter. This is
what you make us do for money."
"Well, not me," I said defensively. "I
mean, not technically. I don't, like,
produce porn movies."
"Look me in the eye and tell me this
doesn't turn you on, Pudge."
I couldn't. She laughed. It was fine,
she said. Healthy. And then she got up,
stopped the tape, lay down on her
stomach across the couch, and mumbled
something.
"What did you say?" I asked,
walking to her, putting my hand on the
small of her back.
"Shhhh," she said. "I'm sleeping."
Just like that. From a hundred miles
an hour to asleep in a nanosecond. I
wanted so badly to lie down next to her
on the couch, to wrap my arms around
her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those
movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep
together, in the most innocent sense of
the phrase. But I lacked the courage and
she had a boyfriend and I was gawky
and she was gorgeous and I was
hopelessly boring and she was endlessly
fascinating. So I walked back to my
room and collapsed on the bottom bunk,
thinking that if people were rain, I was
drizzle and she was a hurricane.
forty-seven days
before
On Wednesday morning,I woke up
with a stuffy nose to an entirely new
Alabama, a crisp and cold one. As I
walked to Alaska's room that morning,
the frosty grass of the dorm circle
crunched beneath my shoes. You don't
run into frost much in Florida — and I
jumped up and down like I was stomping
on bubble wrap. Crunch. Crunch.
Crunch.
Alaska was holding a burning green
candle in her hand upside down,
dripping the wax onto a larger,
homemade volcano that looked a bit like
a Technicolor middle-school-scienceproject
volcano.
"Don't burn yourself," I said as the
flame crept up toward her hand.
"Night falls fast. Today is in the
past," she said without looking up.
"Wait, I've read that before. What is
that?" I asked.
With her free hand, she grabbed a
book and tossed it toward me. It landed
at my feet. "Poem," she said. "Edna St.
Vincent Millay. You've read that?
I'm stunned."
"Oh, I read her biography! Didn't
have her last words in it, though. I was a
little bitter. All I remember is that she
had a lot of sex."
"I know. She's my hero," Alaska said
without a trace of irony. I laughed, but
she didn't notice. "Does it seem at all
odd to you that you enjoy biographies of
great writers a lot more than you enjoy
their actual writing?"
"Nope!" I announced. "Just because
they were interesting people doesn't
mean I care to hear their musings on
nighttime."
"It's about depression, dumb-ass."
"Oooooh, really? Well, jeez, then it's
brilliant," I answered.
She sighed. "All right. The snow
may be falling in the winter of my
discontent, but at least I've got sarcastic
company. Sit down, will ya?"
I sat down next to her with my legs
crossed and our knees touching. She
pulled a clear plastic crate filled with
dozens of candles out from underneath
her bed. She looked at it for a moment,
then handed me a white one and a
lighter.
We spent all morning burning
candles — well, and occasionally
lighting cigarettes off the burning
candles after we stuffed a towel into the
crack at the bottom of her door. Over the
course of two hours, we added a full
foot to the summit of her polychrome
candle volcano.
"Mount St. Helens on acid," she said
At 12:30, after two hours of me begging
for a ride to McDonald's, Alaska
decided it was time for lunch. As we
began to walk to the student parking lot,
I saw a strange car. A small green car. A
hatchback. I've seen that car, I thought.
Where have I seen the car? And then the
Colonel jumped out and ran to meet us.
Rather than, like, I don't know,
"hello" or something, the Colonel began,
"I have been instructed to invite you to
Thanksgiving dinner at Chez Martin."
Alaska whispered into my ear, and
then I laughed and said, "I have been
instructed to accept your invitation." So
we walked over to the Eagle's house,
told him we were going to eat turkey
trailer-park style, and sped away in the
hatchback.
The Colonel explained it to us on the
two-hour car ride south. I was crammed
into the backseat because Alaska had
called shotgun. She usually drove, but
when she didn't, she was shotgun-calling
queen of the world. The Colonel's
mother heard that we were on campus
and couldn't bear the thought of leaving
us family less for Thanksgiving. The
Colonel didn't seem too keen on the
whole idea—"I'm going to have to sleep
in a tent," he said, and I laughed.
Except it turns out he did have to
sleep in a tent, a nice four-person green
outfit shaped like half an egg, but still a
tent. The Colonel's mom lived in a
trailer, as in the kind of thing you might
see attached to a large pickup truck,
except this particular one was old and
falling apart on its cinder blocks, and
probably couldn't have been hooked up
to a truck without disintegrating. It
wasn't even a particularly big trailer. I
could just barely stand up to my full
height without scraping the ceiling. Now
I understood why the Colonel was short
— he couldn't afford to be any taller.
The place was really one long room,
with a full-size bed in the front, a
kitchenette, and a living area in the back
with a TV and a small bathroom — so
small that in order to take a shower, you
pretty much had to sit on the toilet.
"It ain't much," the Colonel's mom
("That's Dolores, not Miss Martin") told
us. "But y'alls a-gonna have a turkey the
size o' the kitchen." She laughed. The
Colonel ushered us out of the trailer
immediately after our brief tour, and we
walked through the neighborhood, a
series of trailers and mobile homes on
dirt roads.
"Well, now you get why I hate rich
people." And I did. I couldn't fathom
how the Colonel grew up in such a small
place. The entire trailer was smaller
than our dorm room. I didn't know what
to say to him, how to make him feel less
embarrassed.
"I'm sorry if it makes you
uncomfortable," he said. "I know it's
probably foreign."
"Not to me," Alaska piped up.
"Well, you don't live in a trailer," he
told her.
"Poor is poor."
"I suppose," the Colonel said.
Alaska decided to go help Dolores
with dinner. She said that it was sexist to
leave the cooking to the women, but
better to have good sexist food than
crappy boy-prepared food. So the
Colonel and I sat on the pull-out couch
in the living room, playing video games
and talking about school.
"I finished my religion paper. But I
have to type it up on your computer
when we get back. I think I'm ready for
finals, which is good, since we have an
ank-pray to an-play."
"Your mom doesn't know pig Latin?"
I smirked.
"Not if I talk fast. Christ, be quiet."
The food — fried okra, steamed corn
on the cob, and pot roast that was so
tender it fell right off the plastic fork —
convinced me that Dolores was an even
better cook than Maureen. Culver
Creek's okra had less grease, more
crunch. Dolores was also the funniest
mom I'd ever met. When Alaska asked
her what she did for work, she smiled
and said, "I'm a culnary engineeyer.
That's a short-order cook at the Waffle
House to y'all."
"Best Waffle House in Alabama."
The Colonel smiled, and then I realized,
he wasn't embarrassed of his mom at all.
He was just scared that we would act
like condescending boarding-school
snobs. I'd always found the Colonel's Ihate-the-rich
routine a little overwrought
until I saw him with his mom. He was
the same Colonel, but in a totally
different context. It made me hope that
one day, I could meet Alaska's family,
too.
Dolores insisted that Alaska and I
share the bed, and she slept on the pullout
while the Colonel was out in his tent.
I worried he would get cold, but frankly
I wasn't about to give up my bed with
Alaska. We had separate blankets, and
there were never fewer than three layers
between us, but the possibilities kept me
up half the night.
forty-six days
before
Best thanksgiving food I'd ever had.
No crappy cranberry sauce. Just huge
slabs of moist white meat, corn, green
beans cooked in enough bacon fat to
make them taste like they weren't good
for you, biscuits with gravy, pumpkin pie
for dessert, and a glass of red wine for
each of us. "I believe," Dolores said,
"that yer s'posed to drink white with
turkey, but — now I don't know 'bout
y'all — but I don't s'pose I give a shit."
We laughed and drank our wine, and
then after the meal, we each listed our
gratitudes. My family always did that
before the meal, and we all just rushed
through it to get to the food. So the four
of us sat around the table and shared our
blessings. I was thankful for the fine
food and the fine company, for having a
home on Thanksgiving.
"A trailer, at least," Dolores joked.
"Okay, my turn," Alaska said. "I'm
grateful for having just had my best
Thanksgiving in a decade."
Then the Colonel said, "I'm just
grateful for you, Mom," and Dolores
laughed and said, "That dog won't hunt,
boy."
I didn't exactly know what that
phrase meant, but apparently it meant,
"That was inadequate," because then the
Colonel expanded his list to
acknowledge that he was grateful to be
"the smartest human being in this trailer
park," and Dolores laughed and said,
"Good enough."
And Dolores? She was grateful that
her phone was back on, that her boy was
home, that Alaska helped her cook and
that I had kept the Colonel out of her
hair, that her job was steady and her
coworkers were nice, that she had a
place to sleep and a boy who loved her.
I sat in the back of the hatchback on
the drive home — and that is how I
thought of it: home — and fell asleep to
the highway's monotonous lullaby.
forty-four days
before
"Coosa liquors'entire business
model is built around selling cigarettes
to minors and alcohol to adults." Alaska
looked at me with disconcerting
frequency when she drove, particularly
since we were winding through a
narrow, hilly highway south of school,
headed to the aforementioned Coosa
Liquors. It was Saturday, our last day of
real vacation. "Which is great, if all you
need is cigarettes. But we need booze.
And they card for booze. And my ID
blows. But I'll flirt my way through."
She made a sudden and unsignaled left
turn, pulling onto a road that dropped
precipitously down a hill with fields on
either side, and she gripped the steering
wheel tight as we accelerated, and she
waited until the last possible moment to
brake, just before we reached the bottom
of the hill.
There stood a plywood gas station
that no longer sold gas with a faded sign
bolted to the roof: coosa liquors: we
cater to your spiritual needs.
Alaska went in alone and walked out
the door five minutes later weighed
down by two paper bags filled with
contraband: three cartons of cigarettes,
five bottles of wine, and a fifth of vodka
for the Colonel. On the way home,
Alaska said, "You like knock-knock
jokes?"
"Knock-knock jokes?" I asked. "You
mean like, 'Knock knock…"
"Who's there?" replied Alaska.
"Who."
"Who Who?"
"What are you, an owl?" I finished.
Lame.
"That was brilliant," said Alaska. "I
have one. You start."
"Okay. Knock knock."
"Who's there?" said Alaska.
I looked at her blankly. About a
minute later, I got it, and laughed.
"My mom told me that joke when I
was six. It's still funny."
So I could not have been more
surprised when she showed up sobbing
at Room 43 just as I was putting the
finishing touches on my final paper for
English. She sat down on the couch, her
every exhalation a mix of whimper and
scream.
"I'm sorry," she said, heaving. Snot
was dribbling down her chin.
"What's wrong?" I asked. She picked
up a Kleenex from the coffee table and
wiped at her face.
"I don't…" she started, and then a
sob came like a tsunami, her cry so loud
and childlike that it scared me, and I got
up, sat down next her, and put my arm
around her. She turned away, pushing
her head into the foam of the couch. "I
don't understand why I screw everything
up," she said.
"What, like with Marya? Maybe you
were just scared."
"Scared isn't a good excuse!" she
shouted into the couch. "Scared is the
excuse everyone has always used!" I
didn't know who "everyone" was, or
when "always" was, and as much as I
wanted to understand her ambiguities,
the slyness was growing annoying.
"Why are you upset about this now?"
"It's not just that. It's everything. But
I told the Colonel in the car." She
sniffled but seemed done with the sobs.
"While you were sleeping in the
back. And he said he'd never let me out
of his sight during pranks. That he
couldn't trust me on my own. And I don't
blame him. I don't even trust me."
"It took guts to tell him," I said.
"I have guts, just not when it counts.
Will you — um," and she sat up straight
and then moved toward me, and I raised
my arm as she collapsed into my skinny
chest and cried. I felt bad for her, but
she'd done it to herself. She didn't have
to rat.
"I don't want to upset you, but maybe
you just need to tell us all why you told
on Marya. Were you scared of going
home or something?"
She pulled away from me and gave
me a Look of Doom that would have
made the Eagle proud, and I felt like she
hated me or hated my question or both,
and then she looked away, out the
window, toward the soccer field, and
said, "There's no home."
"Well, you have a family," I
backpedaled. She'd talked to me about
her mom just that morning. How could
the girl who told that joke three hours
before become a sobbing mess?
Still staring at me, she said, "I try not
to be scared, you know. But I still ruin
everything. I still fuck up."
"Okay," I told her. "It's okay." I
didn't even know what she was talking
about anymore. One vague notion after
another.
"Don't you know who you love,
Pudge? You love the girl who makes you
laugh and shows you porn and drinks
wine with you. You don't love the crazy,
sullen bitch."
And there was something to that,
truth be told.
Christmas We all went home for
Christmas break — even purportedly
homeless Alaska.
I got a nice watch and a new wallet
—"grown-up gifts," my dad called them.
But mostly I just studied for those two
weeks. Christmas vacation wasn't really
a vacation, on account of how it was our
last chance to study for exams, which
started the day after we got back. I
focused on precalc and biology, the two
classes that most deeply threatened my
goal of a 3.4 GPA. I wish I could say I
was in it for the thrill of learning, but
mostly I was in it for the thrill of getting
into a worthwhile college.
So, yeah, I spent a lot of my time at
home studying math and memorizing
French vocab, just like I had before
Culver Creek. Really, being at home for
two weeks was just like my entire life
before Culver Creek, except my parents
were more emotional. They talked very
little about their trip to London. I think
they felt guilty. That's a funny thing about
parents. Even though I pretty much
stayed at the Creek over Thanksgiving
because I wanted to, my parents still felt
guilty. It's nice to have people who will
feel guilty for you, although I could have
lived without my mom crying during
every single family dinner. She would
say, "I'm a bad mother," and my dad and
I would immediately reply, "No, you're
not."
Even my dad, who is affectionate but
not, like, sentimental, randomly, while
we were watching The Simpsons, said
he missed me. I said I missed him, too,
and I did. Sort of. They're such nice
people. We went to movies and played
card games, and I told them the stories I
could tell without horrifying them, and
they listened. My dad, who sold real
estate for a living but read more books
than anyone I knew, talked with me
about the books I was reading for
English class, and my mom insisted that I
sit with her in the kitchen and learn how
to make simple dishes — macaroni,
scrambled eggs — now that I was
"living on my own." Never mind that I
didn't have, or want, a kitchen. Never
mind that I didn't like eggs or macaroni
and cheese. By New Year's Day, I could
make them anyway.
When I left, they both cried, my mom
explaining that it was just empty-nest
syndrome, that they were just so proud
of me, that they loved me so much. That
put a lump in my throat, and I didn't care
about Thanksgiving anymore. I had a
family.
eight days before
Alaska walked in on the first day
back from Christmas break and sat
beside the Colonel on the couch. The
Colonel was hard at work, breaking a
land-speed record on the PlayStation.
She didn't say she missed us, or that
she was glad to see us. She just looked
at the couch and said, "You really need a
new couch."
"Please don't address me when I'm
racing," the Colonel said.
"God. Does Jeff Gordon have to put
up with this shit?"
"I've got an idea," she said. "It's
great. What we need is a pre-prank that
coincides with an attack on Kevin and
his minions," she said.
I was sitting on the bed, reading the
textbook in preparation for my American
history exam the next day.
"A pre-prank?" I asked.
"A prank designed to lull the
administration into a false sense of
security," the Colonel answered,
annoyed by the distraction. "After the
pre-prank, the Eagle will think the junior
class has done its prank and won't be
waiting for it when it actually comes."
Every year, the junior and senior classes
pulled off a prank at some point in the
year — usually something lame, like
Roman candles in the dorm circle at five
in the morning on a Sunday.
"Is there always a pre-prank?" I
asked.
"No, you idiot," the Colonel said. "If
there was always a pre-prank, then the
Eagle would expect two pranks. The last
time a pre-prank was used — hmm. Oh,
right: 1987. When the pre-prank was
cutting off electricity to campus, and then
the actual prank was putting five hundred
live crickets in the heating ducts of the
classrooms.
Sometimes you can still hear the
chirping."
"Your rote memorization is, like, so
impressive," I said.
"You guys are like an old married
couple." Alaska smiled. "In a creepy
way."
"You don't know the half of it," the
Colonel said. "You should see this kid
try to crawl into bed with me at night."
"Hey!"
"Let's get on subject!" Alaska said.
"Pre-prank. This weekend, since there's
a new moon. We're staying at the barn.
You, me, the Colonel, Takumi, and, as a
special gift to you, Pudge, Lara
Buterskaya."
"The Lara Buterskaya I puked on?"
"She's just shy. She still likes you."
Alaska laughed. "Puking made you look
— vulnerable."
"Very perky boobs," the Colonel
said. "Are you bringing Takumi for me?"
"You need to be single for a while."
"True enough," the Colonel said.
"Just spend a few more months
playing video games," she said. "That
hand-eye coordination will come in
handy when you get to third base."
"Gosh, I haven't heard the base
system in so long, I think I've forgotten
third base," the Colonel responded. "I
would roll my eyes at you, but I can't
afford to look away from the screen."
"French, Feel, Finger, Fuck. It's like
you skipped third grade," Alaska said.
"I did skip third grade," the Colonel
answered.
"So," I said, "what's our pre-prank?"
"The Colonel and I will work that
out. No need to get you into trouble —
yet."
"Oh. Okay. Um, I'm gonna go for a
cigarette, then."
I left. It wasn't the first time Alaska
had left me out of the loop, certainly, but
after we'd been together so much over
Thanksgiving, it seemed ridiculous to
plan the prank with the Colonel but
without me. Whose T-shirts were wet
with her tears? Mine. Who'd listened to
her read Vonnegut? Me. Who'd been the
butt of the world's worst knock-knock
joke? Me. I walked to the Sunny
Konvenience Kiosk across from school
and smoked. This never happened to me
in Florida, this oh-so-high-school angst
about who likes whom more, and I hated
myself for letting it happen now. You
don't have to care about her, I told
myself. Screw her.
four days before
The colonel wouldn't tell me a word
about the pre-prank, except that it was to
be called Barn Night, and that when I
packed, I should pack for two days.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
were torture. The Colonel was always
with Alaska, and I was never invited. So
I spent an inordinate amount of time
studying for finals, which helped my
GPA considerably. And I finally
finished my religion paper.
My answer to the question was
straightforward enough, really. Most
Christians and Muslims believe in a
heaven and a hell, though there's a lot of
disagreement within both religions over
what, exactly, will get you into one
afterlife or the other. Buddhists are more
complicated — because of the Buddha's
doctrine of anatta, which basically says
that people don't have eternal souls.
Instead, they have a bundle of energy,
and that bundle of energy is transitory,
migrating from one body to another,
reincarnating endlessly until it
eventually reaches enlightenment.
I never liked writing concluding
paragraphs to papers — where you just
repeat what you've already said with
phrases like In summation, a n d To
conclude. I didn't do that — instead I
talked about why I thought it was an
important question. People, I thought,
wanted security. They couldn't bear the
idea of death being a big black nothing,
couldn't bear the thought of their loved
ones not existing, and couldn't even
imagine themselves not existing. I
finally decided that people believed in
an afterlife because they couldn't bear
not to.
three days before
On Friday,after a surprisingly
successful precalc exam that brought my
first set of Culver Creek finals to a
close, I packed clothes ("Think New
York trendy," the Colonel advised.
"Think black. Think sensible.
Comfortable, but warm.") and my
sleeping bag into a backpack, and we
picked up Takumi in his room and
walked to the Eagle's house. The Eagle
was wearing his only outfit, and I
wondered whether he just had thirty
identical white button-down shirts and
thirty identical black ties in his closet. I
pictured him waking up in the morning,
staring at his closet, and thinking,
Hmm…hmm…how about a white shirt
and a black tie? Talk about a guy who
could use a wife.
"I'm taking Miles and Takumi home
for the weekend to New Hope," the
Colonel told him.
"Miles liked his taste of New Hope
that much?" the Eagle asked me.
"Yee haw! There's a gonna be a
hoedown at the trailer park!" the Colonel
said. He could actually have a Southern
accent when he wanted to, although like
most everyone at Culver Creek, he didn't
usually speak with one.
"Hold on one moment while I call
your mom," the Eagle said to the
Colonel.
Takumi looked at me with poorly
disguised panic, and I felt lunch — fried
chicken — rising in my stomach. But the
Colonel just smiled. "Sure thing."
"Chip and Miles and Takumi will be
at your house this weekend?…Yes,
ma'am…. Ha!…Okay. Bye now." The
Eagle looked upat the Colonel. "Your
mom is a wonderful woman." The Eagle
smiled.
"You're tellin' me." The Colonel
grinned. "See you on Sunday."
As we walked toward the gym
parking lot, the Colonel said, "I called
her yesterday and asked her to cover for
me, and she didn't even ask why. She
just said, 'I sure trust you, son,' and hot
damn she does." Once out of sight of the
Eagle's house, we took a sharp right into
the woods.
We walked on the dirt road over the
bridge and back to the school's barn, a
dilapidated leak-prone structure that
looked more like a long-abandoned log
cabin than a barn. They still stored hay
there, although I don't know what for. It
wasn't like we had an equestrian
program or anything. The Colonel,
Takumi, and I got there first, setting up
our sleeping bags on the softest bales of
hay. It was 6:30.
Alaska came shortly after, having
told the Eagle she was spending the
weekend with Jake. The Eagle didn't
check that story, because Alaska spent at
least one weekend there every month,
and he knew that her parents never
cared. Lara showed up half an hour
later. She'd told the Eagle that she was
driving to Atlanta to see an old friend
from Romania. The Eagle called Lara's
parents to make sure that they knew she
was spending a weekend off campus,
and they didn't mind.
"They trust me." She smiled.
"You don't sound like you have an
accent sometimes," I said, which was
pretty stupid, but a darn sight better than
throwing up on her.
"Eet's only soft i's."
"No soft i's in Russian?" I asked.
"Romanian," she corrected me.
Turns out Romanian is a language. Who
knew? My cultural sensitivity quotient
was going to have to drastically increase
if I was going to share a sleeping bag
with Lara anytime soon.
Everybody was sitting on sleeping
bags, Alaska smoking with flagrant
disregard for the overwhelming
flammability of the structure, when the
Colonel pulled out a single piece of
computer paper and read from it.
"The point of this evening's
festivities is to prove once and for all
that we are to pranking what the
Weekday Warriors are to sucking. But
we'll also have the opportunity to make
life unpleasant for the Eagle, which is
always a welcome pleasure. And so," he
said, pausing as if for a drumroll, "we
fight tonight a battle on three fronts:
"Front One: The pre-prank: We will, as
it were, light a fire under the Eagle's ass.
"Front Two: Operation Baldy:
Wherein Lara flies solo in a retaliatory
mission so elegant and cruel that it could
only have been the brainchild of, well,
me."
"Hey!" Alaska interrupted. "It was
my idea."
"Okay, fine. It was Alaska's idea."
He laughed. "And finally, Front Three:
The Progress Reports: We're going to
hack into the faculty computer network
and use their grading database to send
out letters to Kevin et al.'s families
saying that they are failing some of their
classes."
"We are definitely going to get
expelled," I said.
"I hope you didn't bring the Asian
kid along thinking he's a computer
genius. Because I am not," Takumi said.
"We're not going to get expelled and
I'm the computer genius. The rest of you
are muscle and distraction. We won't get
expelled even if we get caught because
there are no expellable offenses here —
well, except for the five bottles of
Strawberry Hill in Alaska's backpack,
and that will be well hidden. We're just,
you know, wreaking a little havoc."
The plan was laid out, and it left no
room for error. The Colonel relied so
heavily on perfect synchronicity that if
one of us messed up even slightly, the
endeavor would collapse entirely.
He had printed up individual
itineraries for each of us, including times
exact to the second. Our watches
synchronized, our clothes black, our
backpacks on, our breath visible in the
cold, our minds filled with the minute
details of the plan, our hearts racing, we
walked out of the barn together once it
was completely dark, around seven. The
five of us walking confidently in a row,
I'd never felt cooler. The Great Perhaps
was upon us, and we were invincible.
The plan may have had faults, but we did
not.
After five minutes, we split up to go
to our destinations. I stuck with Takumi.
We were the distraction.
"We're the fucking Marines," he
said.
"First to fight. First to die," I agreed
nervously.
"Hell yes."
He stopped and opened his bag.
"Not here, dude," I said. "We have to
go to the Eagle's."
"I know. I know. Just — hold on."
He pulled out a thick headband. It was
brown, with a plush fox head on the
front. He put it on hishead.
I laughed. "What the hell is that?"
"It's my fox hat."
"Your fox hat?"
"Yeah, Pudge. My fox hat."
"Why are you wearing your fox
hat?" I asked.
"Because no one can catch the
motherfucking fox."
Two minutes later, we were
crouched behind the trees fifty feet from
the Eagle's back door. My heart thumped
like a techno drumbeat.
"Thirty seconds," Takumi
whispered, and I felt the same spooked
nervousness that I had felt that first night
with Alaska when she grabbed my hand
and whispered run run run run run. But
I stayed put.
I thought: We are not close enough.
I thought: He will not hear it.
I thought: He will hear it and be out
so fast that we will have no chance.
I thought: Twenty seconds. I was
breathing hard and fast.
"Hey, Pudge," Takumi whispered,
"you can do this, dude. It's just running."
"Right." Just running. My knees are
good. My lungs are fair. It's just
running.
"Five," he said. "Four. Three. Two.
One. Light it. Light it. Light it."
It lit with a sizzle that reminded me
of every July Fourth with my family. We
stood still for a nanosecond, staring at
the fuse, making sure it was lit. And now,
I thought. Now. Run run run run run.
But my body didn't move until I heard
Takumi shout-whisper, "Go go go
fucking go."
And we went.
Three seconds later, a huge burst of
pops. It sounded, to me, like the
automatic gunfire in Decapitation, except
louder. We were twenty steps away
already, and I thought my eardrums
would burst.
I thought: Well, he will certainly
hear it.
We ran past the soccer field and into
the woods, running uphill and with only
the vaguest sense of direction. In the
dark, fallen branches and moss-covered
rocks appeared at the last possible
second, and I slipped and fell repeatedly
and worried that the Eagle would catch
up, but I just kept getting up and running
beside Takumi, away from the
classrooms and the dorm circle. We ran
like we had golden shoes. I ran like a
cheetah — well, like a cheetah that
smoked too much. And then, after
precisely one minute of running, Takumi
stopped and ripped open his backpack.
My turn to count down. Staring at my
watch. Terrified. By now, he was surely
out. He was surely running. I wondered
if he was fast. He was old, but he'd be
mad.
"Five four three two one," and the
sizzle. We didn't pause that time, just
ran, still west. Breath heaving. I
wondered if I could do this for thirty
minutes. The firecrackers exploded.
The pops ended, and a voice cried
out, "STOP RIGHT NOW!" But we did
not stop. Stopping was not in the plan.
"I'm the motherfucking fox," Takumi
whispered, both to himself and to me.
"No one can catch the fox."
A minute later, I was on the ground.
Takumi counted down. The fuse lit. We
ran.
But it was a dud. We had prepared
for one dud, bringing an extra string of
firecrackers. Another, though, would
cost the Colonel and Alaska a minute.
Takumi crouched down on the ground, lit
the fuse, and ran. The popping started.
The fireworks bangbangbanged in sync
with my heartbeat.
When the firecrackers finished, I
heard, "STOP OR I'LL CALL THE
POLICE!" And though the voice was
distant, I could feel his Look of Doom
bearing down on me.
"The pigs can't stop the fox; I'm too
quick," Takumi said to himself. "I can
rhyme while I run; I'm that slick."
The Colonel warned us about the
police threat, told us not to worry. The
Eagle didn't like to bring the police to
campus. Bad publicity. So we ran. Over
and under and through all manner of
trees and bushes and branches. We fell.
We got up. We ran. If he couldn't follow
us with the firecrackers, he could sure as
hell follow the sound of our whispered
shits as we tripped over dead logs and
fell into briar bushes.
One minute. I knelt down, lit the
fuse, ran. Bang.
Then we turned north, thinking we'd
gotten past the lake. This was key to the
plan. The farther we got while still
staying on campus, the farther the Eagle
would follow us. The farther he
followed us, the farther he would be
from the classrooms, where the Colonel
and Alaska were working their magic.
And then we planned to loop back near
the classrooms and swing east along the
creek until we came to the bridge over
our Smoking Hole, where we would
rejoin the road and walk back to the
barn, triumphant.
But here's the thing: We made a
slight error in navigation. We weren't
past the lake; instead we were staring at
a field and then the lake. Too close to
the classrooms to run anywhere but
along the lake front, I looked over at
Takumi, who was running with me stride
for stride, and he just said, "Drop one
now."
So I dropped down, lit the fuse, and
we ran. We were running through a
clearing now, and if the Eagle was
behind us, he could see us. We got to the
south corner of the lake and started
running along the shore. The lake wasn't
all that big — maybe a quarter mile
long, so we didn't have far to go when I
saw it.
The swan.
Swimming toward us like a swan
possessed. Wings flapping furiously as it
came, and then it was on the shore in
front of us, making a noise that sounded
like nothing else in this world, like all
the worst parts of a dying rabbit plus all
the worst parts of a crying baby, and
there was no other way, so we just ran. I
hit the swan at a full run and felt it bite
into my ass. And then I was running with
a noticeable limp, because my ass was
on fire, and I thought to myself, What the
hell is in swan saliva that burns so
badly?
The twenty-third string was a dud,
costing us one minute. At that point, I
wanted a minute. I was dying. The
burning sensation in my left buttock had
dulled to an intense aching, magnified
each time I landed on my left leg, so I
was running like an injured gazelle
trying to evade a pride of lions. Our
speed, needless to say, had slowed
considerably. We hadn't heard the Eagle
since we got across the lake, but I didn't
think he had turned around. He was
trying to lull us into complacency, but it
would not work. Tonight, we were
invincible.
Exhausted, we stopped with three
strings left and hoped we'd given the
Colonel enough time. We ran for a few
more minutes, until we found the bank of
the creek. It was so dark and so still that
the tiny stream of water seemed to roar,
but I could still hear our hard, fast
breaths as we collapsed on wet clay and
pebbles beside the creek. Only when we
stopped did I look at Takumi. His face
and arms were scratched, the fox head
now directly over his left ear. Looking at
my own arms, I noticed blood dripping
from the deeper cuts. There were, I
remembered now, some wicked briar
patches, but I was feeling no pain.
Takumi picked thorns out of his leg.
"The fox is fucking tired," he said, and
laughed.
"The swan bit my ass," I told him.
"I saw." He smiled. "Is it bleeding?"
I reached my hand into my pants to
check. No blood, so I smoked to
celebrate.
"Mission accomplished," I said.
"Pudge, my friend, we are
indefuckingstructible."
We couldn't figure out where we
were, because the creek doubles back so
many times through the campus, so we
followed the creek for about ten minutes,
figuring we walked half as fast as we
ran, and then turned left.
"Left, you think?" Takumi asked.
"I'm pretty lost," I said.
"The fox is pointing left. So left."
And, sure enough, the fox took us right
back to the barn.
"You're okay!" Lara said as we
walked up. "I was worried. I saw the
Eagle run out of hees house. He was
wearing pajamas. He sure looked mad."
I said, "Well, if he was mad then, I
wouldn't want to see him now."
"What took you so long?" she asked
me.
"We took the long way home,"
Takumi said. "Plus Pudge is walking
like an old lady with hemorrhoids 'cause
the swan bit him on the ass. Where's
Alaska and the Colonel?"
"I don't know," Lara said, and then
we heard footsteps in the distance,
mutters and cracking branches. In a
flash, Takumi grabbed our sleeping bags
and backpacks and hid them behind
bales of hay. The three of us ran through
the back of the barn and into the waisthigh
grass, and lay down. He tracked us
back to the barn, I thought. We fucked
everything up.
But then I heard the Colonel's voice,
distinct and very annoyed, saying,
"Because it narrows the list of possible
suspects by twenty-three! Why couldn't
you just follow the plan? Christ, where
is everybody?"
We walked back to the barn, a bit
sheepish from having overreacted. The
Colonel sat down on a bale of hay, his
elbows on his knees, his head bowed,
his palms against his forehead. Thinking.
"Well, we haven't been caught yet,
anyway. Okay, first," he said without
looking up, "tell me everything else went
all right. Lara?"
She started talking. "Yes. Good."
"Can I have some more detail,
please?"
"I deed like your paper said. I stayed
behind the Eagle's house until I saw
heem run after Miles and Takumi, and
then I ran behind the dorms. And then I
went through the weendow eento
Keveen's room. Then I put the stuff een
the gel and the conditioner, and then I
deed the same thing een Jeff and
Longwell's room."
"The stuff?" I asked.
"Undiluted industrial-strength blue
number-five hair dye," Alaska said.
"Which I bought with your cigarette
money. Apply it to wet hair, and it won't
wash out for months."
"We dyed their hair blue?"
"Well, technically," the Colonel
said, still speaking into his lap, "they're
going to dye their own hair blue. But we
have certainly made it easier for them. I
know you and Takumi did all right,
because we're here and you're here, so
you did your job. And the good news is
that the three assholes who had the gall
to prank us have progress reports
coming saying that they are failing three
classes."
"Uh-oh. What's the bad news?" Lara
asked.
"Oh, c'mon," Alaska said. "The
other good news is that while the
Colonel was worried he'd heard
something and ran into the woods, I saw
to it that twenty other Weekday Warriors
also have progress reports coming. I
printed out reports for all of them,
stuffed them into metered school
envelopes, and then put then in the
mailbox." She turned to the Colonel.
"You were sure gone a long time," she
said. "The wittle Colonel: so scared of
getting expelled."
The Colonel stood up, towering over
the rest of us as we sat. "That is not good
news! That was not in the plan!
That means there are twenty-three
people who the Eagle can eliminate as
suspects. Twenty-three people who
might figure out it was us and rat!"
"If that happens," Alaska said very
seriously, "I'll take the fall."
"Right." The Colonel sighed. "Like
you took the fall for Paul and Marya.
You'll say that while you were traipsing
through the woods lighting firecrackers
you were simultaneously hacking into the
faculty network and printing out false
progress reports on school stationery?
Because I'm sure that will fly with
the Eagle!"
"Relax, dude," Takumi said. "First
off, we're not gonna get caught. Second
off, if we do, I'll take the fall with
Alaska. You've got more to lose than any
of us." The Colonel just nodded. It was
an undeniable fact: The Colonel would
have no chance at a scholarship to a
good school if he got expelled from the
Creek.
Knowing that nothing cheered up the
Colonel like acknowledging his
brilliance, I asked, "So how'd you hack
the network?"
"I climbed in the window of Dr.
Hyde's office, booted up his computer,
and I typed in his password," he said,
smiling.
"You guessed it?"
"No. On Tuesday I went into his
office and asked him to print me a copy
of the recommended reading list. And
then I watched him type the password:
J3ckylnhyd3."
"Well, shit," Takumi said. "I could
have done that."
"Sure, but then you wouldn't have
gotten to wear that sexy hat," the Colonel
said, laughing. Takumi took the
headband off and put it in his bag.
"Kevin is going to be pissed about
his hair," I said.
"Yeah, well, I'm really pissed about
my waterlogged library. Kevin is a
blowup doll," Alaska said. "Prick us,
we bleed. Prick him, he pops."
"It's true," said Takumi. "The guy is
a dick. He kind of tried to kill you, after
all."
"Yeah, I guess," I acknowledged.
"There are a lot of people here like
that," Alaska went on, still fuming. "You
know? Fucking blowup-doll rich kids."
But even though Kevin had sort of
tried to kill me and all, he really didn't
seem worth hating. Hating the cool kids
takes an awful lot of energy, and I'd
given up on it a long time ago. For me,
the prank was just a response to a
previous prank, just a golden opportunity
to, as the Colonel said, wreak a little
havoc. But to Alaska, it seemed to be
something else, something more.
I wanted to ask her about it, but she
lay back down behind the piles of hay,
invisible again. Alaska was done
talking, and when she was done talking,
that was it. We didn't coax her out for
two hours, until the Colonel unscrewed a
bottle of wine. We passed around the
bottle till I could feel it in my stomach,
sour and warm.
I wanted to like booze more than I
actually did (which is more or less the
precise opposite of how I felt about
Alaska). But that night, the booze felt
great, as the warmth of the wine in my
stomach spread through my body. I didn't
like feeling stupid or out of control, but I
liked the way it made everything
(laughing, crying, peeing in front of your
friends) easier. Why did we drink? For
me, it was just fun, particularly since we
were risking expulsion.
The nice thing about the constant
threat of expulsion at Culver Creek is
that it lends excitement to every moment
of illicit pleasure. The bad thing, of
course, is that there is always the
possibility of actual expulsion.
two days before
I woke up early the next morning, my
lips dry and my breath visible in the
crisp air. Takumi had brought a camp
stove in his backpack, and the Colonel
was huddled over it, heating instant
coffee. The sun shone bright but could
not combat the cold, and I sat with the
Colonel and sipped the coffee ("The
thing about instant coffee is that it smells
pretty good but tastes like stomach bile,"
the Colonel said), and then one by one,
Takumi and Lara and Alaska woke up,
and we spent the day hiding out, but
loudly. Hiding out loud.
At the barn that afternoon, Takumi
decided we needed to have a freestyle
contest. "You start, Pudge," Takumi said.
"Colonel Catastrophe, you're our beat
box." "Dude, I can't rap," I pled.
"That's okay. The Colonel can't drop
beats, either. Just try and rhyme a little
and then send it over to me."
With his hand cupped over his
mouth, the Colonel started to make
absurd noises that sounded more like
farting than bass beats, and I, uh, rapped.
"Um, we're sittin' in the barn and the
sun's goin' down / when I was a kid at
Burger King I wore a crown / dude, I
can't rhyme for shit / so I'll let my boy
Takumi rip it."
Takumi took over without pausing.
"Damn, Pudge, I'm not sure I'm quite
ready / but like Nightmare on Elm
Street's Freddy / I've always got the
goods to rip shit up / last night I drank
wine it was like hiccup hiccup / the
Colonel's beats are sick like malaria /
when I rock the mike the ladies suffer
hysteria / I represent Japan as well as
Birmingham / when I was a kid they
called me yellow man / but I ain't
ashamed a' my skin color / and neither
are the countless bitches that call me
lover."
Alaska jumped in.
"Oh shit did you just diss the
feminine gender / I'll pummel your ass
then stick you in a blender / you think I
like Tori and Ani so I can't rhyme / but I
got flow like Ghostbusters got slime /
objectify women and it's fuckin' on /
you'll be dead and gone like ancient
Babylon."
Takumi picked it up again.
"If my eye offends me I will pluck it
out / I got props for girls like old men
got gout / oh shit now my rhyming got all
whack / Lara help me out and pick up the
slack."
Lara rhymed quietly and nervously
— and with even more flagrant
disregard for the beat than me. "My
name's Lara and I'm from Romania /
thees is pretty hard, um, I once visited
Albania / I love riding in Alaska's Geo /
My two best vowels in English are EO I
I'm not so good weeth the leetle i's / but
they make me sound cosmopoleeteen,
right? / Oh, Takumi, I think I'm done /
end thees game weeth some fun."
"I drop bombs like Hiroshima, or
better yet Nagasaki / when girls hear me
flow they think that I'm Rocky / to
represent my homeland I still drink sake
/ the kids don't get my rhymin' so
sometimes they mock me / my build ain't
small but I wouldn't call it stocky / then
again, unlike Pudge, I'm not super gawky
/ I'm the fuckin' fox and this is my crew /
our freestyle's infused with funk like my
gym shoes. And we're out."
The Colonel rapped it up with
freestyle beat-boxing, and we gave
ourselves a round of applause.
"You ripped it up, Alaska," Takumi
says, laughing.
"I do what I can to represent the
ladies. Lara had my back."
"Yeah, I deed."
And then Alaska decided that
although it wasn't nearly dark yet, it was
time for us to get shitfaced.
"Two nights in a row is maybe
pushing our luck," Takumi said as
Alaska opened the wine.
"Luck is for suckers." She smiled
and put the bottle to her lips. We had
saltines and a hunk of Cheddar cheese
provided by the Colonel for dinner, and
sipping the warm pink wine out of the
bottle with our cheese and saltines made
for a fine dinner. And when we ran out
of cheese, well, all the more room for
Strawberry Hill.
"We have to slow down or I'll
puke," I remarked after we finished the
first bottle.
"I'm sorry, Pudge. I wasn't aware
that someone was holding open your
throat and pouring wine down it," the
Colonel responded, tossing me a bottle
of Mountain Dew.
"It's a little charitable to call this shit
wine," Takumi cracked.
And then, as if out of nowhere,
Alaska announced, "Best Day/Worst
Day!"
"Huh?" I asked.
"We are all going to puke if we just
drink. So we'll slow it down with a
drinking game. Best Day/Worst Day."
"Never heard of it," the Colonel
said.
"'Cause I just made it up." She
smiled. She lay on her side across two
bales of hay, the afternoon light
brightening the green in her eyes, her tan
skin the last memory of fall. With her
mouth half open, it occurred to me that
she must already be drunk as I noticed
the far-off look in her eyes. The
thousand-yard stare of intoxication, I
thought, and as I watched her with an
idle fascination, it occurred to me that,
yeah, I was a little drunk, too.
"Fun! What are the rules?" Lara
asked.
"Everybody tells the story of their
best day. The best storyteller doesn't
have to drink. Then everybody tells the
story of their worst day, and the best
storyteller doesn't have to drink. Then
we keep going, second best day, second
worst day, until one of y'all quits."
"How do you know it'll be one of
us?" Takumi asked.
"'Cause I'm the best drinker and the
best storyteller," she answered. Hard to
disagree with that logic. "You start,
Pudge. Best day of your life."
"Urn. Can I take a minute to think of
one?"
"Couldn'ta been that good if you
have to think about it," the Colonel said.
"Fuck you, dude."
"Touchy."
"Best day of my life was today," I
said. "And the story is that I woke up
next to a very pretty Hungarian girl and
it was cold but not too cold and I had a
cup of lukewarm instant coffee and ate
Cheerios without milk and then walked
through the woods with Alaska and
Takumi. We skipped stones across the
creek, which sounds dumb but it wasn't.
I don't know. Like the way the sun is
right now, with the long shadows and
that kind of bright, soft light you get
when the sun isn't quite setting? That's
the light that makes everything better,
everything prettier, and today, everything
just seemed to be in that light. I mean, I
didn't do anything. But just sitting here,
even if I'm watching the Colonel whittle,
or whatever. Whatever. Great day.
Today. Best day of my life."
"You think I'm pretty?" Lara said,
and laughed, bashful. I thought, It'd be
good to make eye contact with her now,
but I couldn't. "And I'm Romaneean!"
"That story ended up being a hell of
a lot better than I thought it would be,"
Alaska said, "but I've still got you beat."
"Bring it on, baby," I said. A breeze
picked up, the tall grass outside the barn
tilting away from it, and I pulled my
sleeping bag over my shoulders to stay
warm.
"Best day of my life was January 9,
1997. I was eight years old, and my mom
and I went to the zoo on a class trip.
I liked the bears. She liked the
monkeys. Best day ever. End of story."
"That's it?!" the Colonel said. "That's
the best day of your whole life?!"
"Yup."
"I liked eet," Lara said. "I like the
monkeys, too."
"Lame," said the Colonel. I didn't
think it was lame so much as more of
Alaska's intentional vagueness, another
example of her furthering her own
mysteriousness. But still, even though I
knew it was intentional, I couldn't help
but wonder: What's so fucking great
about the zoo? But before I could ask,
Lara spoke.
"'Kay, my turn," said Lara. "Eet's
easy. The day I came here. I knew
Engleesh and my parents deedn't, and we
came off the airplane and my relatives
were here, aunts and uncles I had not
ever seen, in the airport, and my parents
were so happy. I was twelve, and I had
always been the leetle baby, but that was
the first day that my parents needed me
and treated me like a grown-up. Because
they did not know the language, right?
They need me to order food and to
translate tax and immigration forms and
everytheeng else, and that was the day
they stopped treating me like a keed.
Also, in Romania, we were poor. And
here, we're kinda reech." She laughed.
"All right." Takumi smiled, grabbing
the bottle of wine. "I lose. Because the
best day of my life was the day I lost my
virginity. And if you think I'm going to
tell you that story, you're gonna have to
get me drunker than this."
"Not bad," the Colonel said. "That's
not bad. Want to know my best day?"
"That's the game, Chip," Alaska said,
clearly annoyed.
"Best day of my life hasn't happened
yet. But I know it. I see it every day. The
best day of my life is the day I buy my
mom a huge fucking house. And not just
like out in the woods, but in the middle
of Mountain Brook, with all the
Weekday Warriors' parents. With all
y'all's parents. And I'm not buying it with
a mortgage either. I'm buying it with cash
money, and I am driving my mom there,
and I'm going to open her side of the car
door and she'll get out and look at this
house — this house is like picket fence
and two stories and everything, you
know — and I'm going to hand her the
keys to her house and I'll say, 'Thanks.'
Man, she helped fill out my application
to this place.
And she let me come here, and that's
no easy thing when you come from
where we do, to let your son go away to
school. So that's the best day of my life."
Takumi tilted the bottle up and
swallowed a few times, then handed it to
me. I drank, and so did Lara, and then
Alaska put her head back and turned the
bottle upside down, quickly downing the
last quarter of the bottle.
As she unscrewed the next bottle,
Alaska smiled at the Colonel. "You won
that round. Now what's your worst day?"
"Worst day was when my dad left.
He's old — he's like seventy now — and
he was old when he married my mom,
and he still cheated on her. And she
caught him, and she got pissed, so he hit
her. And then she kicked him out, and he
left. I was here, and my mom called, and
she didn't tell me the whole story with
the cheating and everything and the
hitting until later. She just said that he
was gone and not coming back. And I
haven't seen him since. All that day, I
kept waiting for him to call me and
explain it, but he never did. He never
called at all. I at least thought he would
say good-bye or something. That was the
worst day."
"Shit, you got me beat again," I said.
"My worst day was in seventh grade,
when Tommy Hewitt pissed on my gym
clothes and then the gym teacher said I
had to wear my uniform or I'd fail the
class. Seventh-grade gym, right? There
are worse things to fail. But it was a big
deal then, and I was crying, and trying to
explain to the teacher what happened,
but it was so embarrassing, and he just
yelled and yelled and yelled until I put
on these piss-soaked shorts and T-shirt.
That was the day I stopped caring what
people did. I just never cared anymore,
about being a loser or not having friends
or any of that. So I guess it was good for
me in a way, but that moment was awful.
I mean, imagine me playing volleyball or
whatever in pee-soaked gym clothes
while Tommy Hewitt tells everyone
what he did. That was the worst day."
Lara was laughing. "I'm sorry,
Miles."
"All good," I said. "Just tell me
yours so I can laugh at your pain," and I
smiled, and we laughed together.
"My worst day was probably the
same day as my best. Because I left
everytheeng. I mean, eet sounds dumb,
but my childhood, too, because most
twelve-year-olds do not, you know, have
to feegure out W-2 forms."
"What's a W-2 form?" I asked.
"That's my point. Eet's for taxes. So.
Same day."
Lara had always needed to talk for
her parents, I thought, and so maybe she
never learned how to talk for herself.
And I wasn't great at talking for
myself either. We had something
important in common, then, a personality
quirk I didn't share with Alaska or
anybody else, although almost by
definition Lara and I couldn't express it
to each other. So maybe it was just the
way the not-yet-setting sun shone against
her lazy dark curls, but at that moment, I
wanted to kiss her, and we did not need
to talk in order to kiss, and the puking on
her jeans and the months of mutual
avoidance melted away.
"Eet's your turn, Takumi."
"Worst day of my life," Takumi said.
"June 9, 2000. My grandmother died in
Japan. She died in a car accident, and I
was supposed to leave to go see her two
days later. I was going to spend the
whole summer with her and my
grandfather, but instead I flew over for
her funeral, and the only time I really
saw what she looked like, I mean other
than in pictures, was at her funeral. She
had a Buddhist funeral, and they
cremated her, but before they did she
was on this, like — well, it's not really
Buddhist. I mean, religion is
complicated there, so it's a little
Buddhist and a little Shinto, but y'all
don't care — point being that she was on
this, like, funeral pyre or whatever. And
that's the only time I ever saw her, was
just before they burned her up. That was
the worst day."
The Colonel lit a cigarette, threw it
to me, and lit one of his own. It was
eerie, that he could tell when I wanted a
cigarette. We were like an old married
couple. For a moment, I thought. It's
massively unwise to throw lit cigarettes
around a barn full of hay, but then the
moment of caution passed, and I just
made a sincere effort not to flick ash
onto any hay.
"No clear winner yet," the Colonel
said. "The field is wide open. Your turn,
buddy."
Alaska lay on her back, her hands
locked behind her head. She spoke softly
and quickly, but the quiet day was
becoming a quieter night — the bugs
gone now with the arrival of winter —
and we could hear her clearly.
"The day after my mom took me to
the zoo where she liked the monkeys and
I liked the bears, it was a Friday. I came
home from school. She gave me a hug
and told me to go do my homework in
my room so I could watch TV later. I
went into my room, and she sat down at
the kitchen table, I guess, and then she
screamed, and I ran out, and she had
fallen over. She was lying on the floor,
holding her head and jerking. And I
freaked out. I should have called 911,
but I just started screaming and crying
until finally she stopped jerking, and I
thought she had fallen asleep and that
whatever had hurt didn't hurt anymore.
So I just sat there on the floor with her
until my dad got home an hour later, and
he's screaming, 'Why didn't you call
911?' and trying to give her CPR, but by
then she was plenty dead. Aneurysm.
Worst day. I win. You drink."
And so we did.
No one talked for a minute, and then
Takumi asked, "Your dad blamed you?"
"Well, not after that first moment.
But yeah. How could he not?"
"Well, you were a little kid," Takumi
argued. I was too surprised and
uncomfortable to talk, trying to fit this
into what I knew about Alaska's family.
Her mom told her the knock-knock joke
— when Alaska was six. Her mom used
to smoke — but didn't anymore,
obviously.
"Yeah. I was a little kid. Little kids
can dial 911. They do it all the time.
Give me the wine," she said, deadpan
and emotionless. She drank without
lifting her head from the hay.
"I'm sorry," Takumi said.
"Why didn't you ever tell me?" the
Colonel asked, his voice soft.
"It never came up." And then we
stopped asking questions. What the hell
do you say?
In the long quiet that followed, as we
passed around the wine and slowly
became drunker, I found myself thinking
about President William McKinley, the
third American president to be
assassinated. He lived for several days
after he was shot, and toward the end,
his wife started crying and screaming, "I
want to go, too! I want to go, too!" And
with his last measure of strength,
McKinley turned to her and spoke his
last words: "We are all going."
It was the central moment of
Alaska's life. When she cried and told
me that she fucked everything up, I knew
what she meant now. And when she said
she failed everyone, I knew whom she
meant. It was the everything and the
everyone of her life, and so I could not
help but imagine it: I imagined a
scrawny eight-year-old with dirty
fingers, looking down at her mother
convulsing. So she sat down with her
dead-or-maybe-not mother, who I
imagine was not breathing by then but
wasn't yet cold either. And in the time
between dying and death, a little Alaska
sat with her mother in silence. And then
through the silence and my drunkenness,
I caught a glimpse of her as she might
have been. She must have come to feel
so powerless, I thought, that the one
thing she might have done — pick up the
phone and call an ambulance — never
even occurred to her. There comes a
time when we realize that our parents
cannot save themselves or save us, that
everyone who wades through time
eventually gets dragged out to sea by the
undertow — that, in short, we are all
going.
So she became impulsive, scared by
her inaction into perpetual action. When
the Eagle confronted her with expulsion,
maybe she blurted out Marya's name
because it was the first that came to
mind, because in that moment she didn't
want to get expelled and couldn't think
past that moment. She was scared, sure.
But more importantly, maybe she'd been
scared of being paralyzed by fear again.
"We are all going," McKinley said
to his wife, and we sure are. There's
your labyrinth of suffering. We are all
going. Find your way out of that maze.
None of which I said out loud to her.
Not then and not ever. We never said
another word about it. Instead, it became
just another worst day, albeit the worst
of the bunch, and as night fell fast, we
continued on, drinking and joking.
Later that night, after Alaska stuck
her finger down her throat and made
herself puke in front of all of us because
she was too drunk towalk into the
woods, I lay down in my sleeping bag.
Lara was lying beside me, in her bag,
which was almost touching mine. I
moved my arm to the edge of my bag and
pushed it so it slightly overlapped with
hers. I pressed my hand against hers. I
could feel it, although there were two
sleeping bags between us. My plan,
which struck me as very slick, was to
pull my arm out of my sleeping bag and
put it into hers, and then hold her hand. It
was a good plan, but when I tried to
actually get my arm out of the mummy
bag, I flailed around like a fish out of
water, and nearly dislocated my
shoulder. She was laughing — and not
with me, at me — but we still didn't
speak. Having passed the point of no
return, I slid my hand into her sleeping
bag anyway, and she stifled a giggle as
my fingers traced a line from her elbow
to her wrist.
"That teekles," she whispered. So
much for me being sexy.
"Sorry," I whispered.
"No, it's a nice teekle," she said, and
held my hand. She laced her fingers in
mine and squeezed. And then she rolled
over and keessed me. I am sure that she
tasted like stale booze, but I did not
notice, and I'm sure I tasted like stale
booze and cigarettes, but she didn't
notice. We were kissing.
I thought: This is good.
I thought: I am not bad at this
kissing. Not bad at all.
I thought: I am clearly the greatest
kisser in the history of the universe.
Suddenly she laughed and pulled
away from me. She wiggled a hand out
of her sleeping bag and wiped her face.
"You slobbered on my nose," she
said, and laughed.
I laughed, too, trying to give her the
impression that my nose-slobbering
kissing style was intended to be funny.
"I'm sorry." To borrow the base
system from Alaska, I hadn't hit more
than five singles in my entire life, so I
tried to chalk it up to inexperience. "I'm
a bit new at this," I said.
"Eet was a nice slobbering," she
said, laughed, and kissed me again. Soon
we were entirely out of our sleeping
bags, making out quietly. She lay on top
of me, and I held her small waist in my
hands. I could feel her breasts against
my chest, and she moved slowly on top
of me, her legs straddling me. "You feel
nice," she said.
"You're beautiful," I said, and smiled
at her. In the dark, I could make out the
outline of her face and her large, round
eyes blinking down at me, her eyelashes
almost fluttering against my forehead.
"Could the two people who are
making out please be quiet?" the Colonel
asked loudly from his sleeping bag.
"Those of us who are not making out
are drunk and tired."
"Mostly. Drunk," Alaska said
slowly, as if enunciation required great
effort.
We had almost never talked, Lara
and I, and we didn't get a chance to talk
anymore because of the Colonel. So we
kissed quietly and laughed softly with
our mouths and our eyes. After so much
kissing that it almost started to get
boring, I whispered, "Do you want to be
my girlfriend?" And she said, "Yes
please," and smiled. We slept together in
her sleeping bag, which felt a little
crowded, to be honest, but was still
nice. I had never felt another person
against me as I slept. It was a fine end to
the best day of my life.
one day before
The next morning,a term I use
loosely since it was not yet dawn, the
Colonel shook me awake. Lara was
wrapped in my arms, folded into my
body.
"We gotta go, Pudge. Time to roll
up."
"Dude. Sleeping."
"You can sleep after we check in.
IT'S TIME TO GO!" he shouted.
"All right. All right. No screaming.
Head hurts." And it did. I could feel last
night's wine in my throat and my head
throbbed like it had the morning after my
concussion. My mouth tasted like a
skunk had crawled into my throat and
died. I made an effort not to exhale near
Lara as she groggily extricated herself
from the sleeping bag.
We packed everything quickly, threw
our empty bottles into the tall grass of
the field — littering was an unfortunate
necessity at the Creek, since no one
wanted to throw an empty bottle of
booze in a campus trash can — and
walked away from the barn. Lara
grabbed my hand and then shyly let go.
Alaska looked like a train wreck, but
insisted on pouring the last few sips of
Strawberry Hill into her cold instant
coffee before chucking the bottle behind
her.
"Hair of the dog," she said.
"How ya doin'?" the Colonel asked
her.
"I've had better mornings."
"Hungover?"
"Like an alcoholic preacher on
Sunday morning."
"Maybe you shouldn't drink so
much," I suggested.
"Pudge." She shook her head and
sipped the cold coffee and wine. "Pudge,
what you must understand about me is
that I am a deeply unhappy person."
We walked side by side down the
washed-out dirt road on our way back to
campus. Just after we reached the
bridge, Takumi stopped, said "uh-oh,"
got on his hands and knees, and puked a
volcano of yellow and pink.
"Let it out," Alaska said. "You'll be
fine."
He finished, stood up, and said, "I
finally found something that can stop the
fox. The fox cannot summit Strawberry
Hill."
Alaska and Lara walked to their
rooms, planning to check in with the
Eagle later in the day, while Takumi and
I stood behind the Colonel as he knocked
on the Eagle's door at 9:00 a.m.
"Y'all are home early. Have fun?"
"Yes sir," the Colonel said.
"How's your mom, Chip?"
"She's doing well, sir. She's in good
shape."
"She feed y'all well?"
"Oh yes sir," I said. "She tried to
fatten me up."
"You need it. Y'all have a good
day."
"Well, I don't think he suspected
anything," the Colonel said on our way
back to Room 43. "So maybe we
actually pulled it off." I thought about
going over to see Lara, but I was pretty
tired, so I just went to bed and slept
through my hangover.
It was not an eventful day. I should
have done extraordinary things. I should
have sucked the marrow out of life.
But on that day, I slept eighteen
hours out of a possible twenty-four.
the last day
The next morning,the first Monday of
the new semester, the Colonel came out
of the shower just as my alarm went off.
As I pulled on my shoes, Kevin knocked
once and then opened the door, stepping
inside. "You're looking good," the
Colonel said casually. Kevin's now
sported a crew cut, a small patch of
short blue hair on each side of his head,
just above the ear. His lower lip jutted
out — the morning's first dip. He walked
over to ourcoffee table, picked up a can
of Coke, and spit into it.
"You almost didn't get me. I noticed
it in my conditioner and got right back in
the shower. But I didn't notice it in my
gel. It didn't show up in Jeff's hair at all.
But Longwell and me, we had to go with
the Marine look. Thank God I have
clippers."
"It suits you," I said, although it
didn't. The short hair accentuated his
features, specifically his too-closetogether
beady eyes, which did not stand
up well to accentuation. The Colonel
was trying hard to look tough — ready
for whatever Kevin might do — but it's
hard to look tough when you're only
wearing an orange towel.
"Truce?"
"Well, your troubles aren't over, I'm
afraid," the Colonel said, referring to the
mailed-but-not-yet-received progress
reports.
"A'ight. If you say so. We'll talk
when it's over, I guess."
"I guess so," the Colonel said. As
Kevin walked out, the Colonel said,
"Take the can you spit in, you unhygienic
shit." Kevin just closed the door behind
him. The Colonel grabbed the can,
opened the door, and threw it at Kevin
— missing him by a good margin.
"Jeez, go easy on the guy."
"No truce yet. Pudge."
I spent that afternoon with Lara. We
were very cutesy, even though we didn't
know the first thing about each other and
barely talked. But we made out. She
grabbed my butt at one point, and I sort
of jumped. I was lying down, but I did
the best version of jumping that one can
do lying down, and she said, "Sorry,"
and I said, "No, it's okay. It's just a little
sore from the swan."
We walked to the TV room together,
and I locked the door. We were
watching The Brady Bunch, which she
had never seen. The episode, where the
Bradys visit the gold-mining ghost town
and they all get locked up in the oneroom
jail by some crazy old gold panner
with a scraggly white beard, was
especially horrible, and gave us a lot to
laugh about. Which is good, since we
didn't have much to talk about.
Just as the Bradys were getting
locked in jail, Lara randomly asked me,
"Have you ever gotten a blow job?"
"Urn, that's out of the blue," I said.
"The blue?"
"Like, you know, out of left field."
"Left field?"
"Like, in baseball. Like, out of
nowhere. I mean, what made you think of
that?"
"I've just never geeven one," she
answered, her little voice dripping with
seductiveness. It was so brazen. I
thought I would explode. I never thought.
I mean, from Alaska, hearing that stuff
was one thing. But to hear her sweet
little Romanian voice go so sexy all of
the sudden…
"No," I said. "I never have."
"Think it would be fun?"
DO I!?!?!?!?!?!?!"Urn. yeah. I mean,
you don't have to."
"I think I want to," she said, and we
kissed a little, and then. And then with
me sitting watching The Brady Bunch,
watching Marcia Marcia Marcia up to
her Brady antics, Lara unbuttoned my
pants and pulled my boxers down a little
and pulled out my penis.
"Wow," she said.
"What?"
She looked up at me, but didn't
move, her face nanometers away from
my penis. "It's weird."
"What do you mean weird?"
"Just beeg, I guess."
I could live with that kind of weird.
And then she wrapped her hand around it
and put it into her mouth.
And waited.
We were both very still. She did not
move a muscle in her body, and I did not
move a muscle in mine. I knew that at
this point something else was supposed
to happen, but I wasn't quite sure what.
She stayed still. I could feel her
nervous breath. For minutes, for as long
as it took the Bradys to steal the key and
unlock themselves from the ghost-town
jail, she lay there, stock-still with my
penis in her mouth, and I sat there,
waiting.
And then she took it out of her mouth
and looked up at me quizzically.
"Should I do sometheeng?"
"Urn. I don't know," I said.
Everything I'd learned from watching
porn with Alaska suddenly exited my
brain. I thought maybe she should move
her head up and down, but wouldn't that
choke her? So I just stayed quiet.
"Should I, like, bite?"
"Don't bite! I mean, I don't think. I
think — I mean, that felt good. That was
nice. I don't know if there's something
else."
"I mean, you deedn't—" "Urn. Maybe
we should ask Alaska."
So we went to her room and asked
Alaska. She laughed and laughed. Sitting
on her bed, she laughed until she cried.
She walked into the bathroom, returned
with a tube of toothpaste, and showed
us. In detail. Never have I so wanted to
be Crest Complete.
Lara and I went back to her room,
where she did exactly what Alaska told
her to do, and I did exactly what Alaska
said I would do, which was die a
hundred little ecstatic deaths, my fists
clenched, my body shaking. It was my
first orgasm with a girl, and afterward, I
was embarrassed and nervous, and so,
clearly, was Lara, who finally broke the
silence by asking, "So, want to do some
homework?"
There was little to do on the first day
of the semester, but she read for her
English class. I picked up a biography of
Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara
— whose face adorned a poster on the
wall — that Lara's roommate had on her
bookshelf, then I lay down next to Lara
on the bottom bunk. I began at the end, as
I sometimes did with biographies I had
no intention of reading all the way
through, and found his last words
without too much searching. Captured by
the Bolivian army, Guevara said,
"Shoot, coward. You are only going to
kill a man." I thought back to Simon
Bolivar's last words in Garcia
Marquez's novel—"How will I ever get
out of this labyrinth!"
South American revolutionaries, it
would seem, died with flair. I read the
last words out loud to Lara. She turned
on her side, placing her head on my
chest.
"Why do you like last words so
much?"
Strange as it might seem, I'd never
really thought about why. "I don't know,"
I said, placing my hand against the small
of her back.
"Sometimes, just because they're
funny. Like in the Civil War, a general
named Sedgwick said, 'They couldn't hit
an elephant from this dis—' and then he
got shot." She laughed. "But a lot of
times, people die how they live. And so
last words tell me a lot about who
people were, and why they became the
sort of people biographies get written
about. Does that make sense?"
"Yeah," she said.
"Yeah?" Just yeah?
"Yeah," she said, and then went back
to reading.
I didn't know how to talk to her. And
I was frustrated with trying, so after a
little while, I got up to go.
I kissed her good-bye. I could do
that, at least.
I picked up Alaska and the Colonel
at our room and we walked down to the
bridge, where I repeated in
embarrassing detail the fellatio fiasco.
"I can't believe she went down on
you twice in one day," the Colonel said.
"Only technically. Really just once,"
Alaska corrected.
"Still. I mean. Still. Pudge got his
hog smoked."
"The poor Colonel," Alaska said
with a rueful smile. "I'd give you a pity
blow, but I really am attached to Jake."
"That's just creepy," the Colonel
said. "You're only supposed to flirt with
Pudge."
"But Pudge has a giiirrrrlllf riend."
She laughed.
That night, the Colonel and I walked
down to Alaska's room to celebrate our
Barn Night success. She and the Colonel
had been celebrating a lot the past
couple days, and I didn't feel up to
climbing Strawberry Hill, so I sat and
munched on pretzels while Alaska and
the Colonel drank wine from paper cups
with flowers on them.
"We ain't drinkin' out the bottle
tonight, nun," the Colonel said.
"We classin' it up!"
"It's an old-time Southern drinking
contest," Alaska responded.
"We's a-gonna treat Pudge to an
evening of real Southern livin': We go'n
match each other Dixie cup for Dixie
cup till the lesser drinker falls."
And that is pretty much what they
did, pausing only to turn out the lights at
11:00 so the Eagle wouldn't drop by.
They chatted some, but mostly they
drank, and I drifted out of the
conversation and ended up squinting
through the dark, looking at the book
spines in Alaska's Life Library. Even
minus the books she'd lost in the miniflood,
I could have stayed up until
morning reading through the haphazard
stacks of titles. A dozen white tulips in a
plastic vase were precariously perched
atop one of the book stacks, and when I
asked her about them, she just said,
"Jake and my's anniversary," and I didn't
care to continue that line of dialogue, so
I went back to scanning titles, and I was
just wondering how I could go about
learning Edgar Allan Poe's last words
(for the record: "Lord help my poor
soul") when I heard Alaska say, "Pudge
isn't even listening to us."
And I said, "I'm listening."
"We were just talking about Truth or
Dare. Played out in seventh grade or still
cool?"
"Never played it," I said. "No
friends in seventh grade."
"Well, that does it!" she shouted, a
bit too loud given the late hour and also
given the fact that she was openly
drinking wine in the room. "Truth or
Dare!"
"All right," I agreed, "but I'm not
making out with the Colonel."
The Colonel sat slumped in the
corner. "Can't make out. Too drunk."
Alaska started. "Truth or Dare,
Pudge."
"Dare."
"Hook up with me."
So I did.
It was that quick. I laughed, looked
nervous, and she leaned in and tilted her
head to the side, and we were kissing.
Zero layers between us. Our tongues
dancing back and forth in each other's
mouth until there was no her mouth and
my mouth but only our mouths
intertwined. She tasted like cigarettes
and Mountain Dew and wine and Chap
Stick. Her hand came to my face and I
felt her soft fingers tracing the line of my
jaw. We lay down as we kissed, she on
top of me, and I began to move beneath
her. I pulled away for a moment, to say,
"What is going on here?" and she put one
finger to her lips and we kissed again. A
hand grabbed one of mine and she
placed it on her stomach. I moved
slowly on top of her and felt her arching
her back fluidly beneath me.
I pulled away again. "What about
Lara? Jake?" Again, she sshed me. "Less
tongue, more lips," she said, and I tried
my best. I thought the tongue was the
whole point, but she was the expert.
"Christ," the Colonel said quite
loudly. "That wretched beast, drama,
draws nigh."
But we paid no attention. She moved
my hand from her waist to her breast,
and I felt cautiously, my fingers moving
slowly under her shirt but over her bra,
tracing the outline of her breasts and then
cupping one in my hand, squeezing
softly. "You're good at that," she
whispered. Her lips never left mine as
she spoke. We moved together, my body
between her legs.
"This is so fun," she whispered, "but
I'm so sleepy. To be continued?" She
kissed me for another moment, my mouth
straining to stay near hers, and then she
moved from beneath me, placed her head
on my chest, and fell asleep instantly.
We didn't have sex. We never got
naked. I never touched her bare breast,
and her hands never got lower than my
hips. It didn't matter. As she slept, I
whispered, "I love you, Alaska Young."
Just as I was falling asleep, the
Colonel spoke. "Dude, did you just make
out with Alaska?"
"Yeah."
"This is going to end poorly," he
said to himself.
And then I was asleep. That deep,
can-still-taste-her-in-my-mouth sleep,
that sleep that is not particularly restful
but is difficult to wake from all the
same. And then I heard the phone ring. I
think. And I think, although I can't know,
that I felt Alaska get up. I think I heard
her leave. I think. How long she was
gone is impossible to know.
But the Colonel and I both woke up
when she returned, whenever that was,
because she slammed the door. She was
sobbing, like that post-Thanksgiving
morning but worse.
"I have to get out of here!" she cried.
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"I forgot! God, how many times can I
fuck up?" she said. I didn't even have
time to wonder what she forgot before
she screamed, "I JUST HAVE TO GO.
HELP ME GET OUT OF HERE!"
"Where do you need to go?"
She sat down and put her head
between her legs, sobbing. "Just please
distract the Eagle right now so I can go.
Please."
The Colonel and I, at the same
moment, equal in our guilt, said, "Okay."
"Just don't turn on your lights," the
Colonel said. "Just drive slow and don't
turn on your lights. Are you sure you're
okay?"
"Fuck," she said. "Just get rid of the
Eagle for me," she said, her sobs
childlike half screams. "God oh God, I'm
so sorry."
"Okay," the Colonel said. "Start the
car when you hear the second string."
We left.
We did not say: Don't drive. You're
drunk.
We did not say: We aren't letting
you in that car when you are upset.
We did not say: We insist on going
with you.
We did not say: This can wait until
tomorrow. Anything — everything —
can wait.
We walked to our bathroom,
grabbed the three strings of leftover
firecrackers from beneath the sink, and
ran to the Eagle's. We weren't sure that it
would work again.
But it worked well enough. The
Eagle tore out of his house as soon as the
first string of firecrackers started
popping — he was waiting for us, I
suppose — and we headed for the
woods and got him in deeply enough that
he never heard her drive away. The
Colonel and I doubled back, wading
through the creek to save time, slipped in
through the back window of Room 43,
and slept like babies.
After
the day after
The colonel slept the not-restful
sleep of the drunk, and I lay on my back
on the bottom bunk, my mouth tingling
and alive as if still kissing, and we
would have likely slept through our
morning classes had the Eagle not
awoken us at 8:00 with three quick
knocks. I rolled over as he opened the
door, and the morning light rushed into
the room.
"I need y'all to go to the gym," he
said. I squinted toward him, the Eagle
himself backlit into invisibility by the
too bright sun.
"Now," he added, and I knew it. We
were done for. Caught. Too many
progress reports. Too much drinking in
too short a time. Why did they have to
drink last night? And then I could taste
her again, the wine and the cigarette
smoke and the Chap Stick and Alaska,
and I wondered if she had kissed me
because she was drunk. Don't expel me,
I thought. Don't I have just begun to kiss
her.
And as if answering my prayers, the
Eagle said, "You're not in any trouble.
But you need to go to the gym now."
I heard the Colonel rolling over
above me. "What's wrong?"
"Something terrible has happened,"
the Eagle said, and then closed the door.
As he grabbed a pair of jeans lying
on the floor, the Colonel said, "This
happened a couple years ago. When
Hyde's wife died. I guess it's the Old
Man himself now. Poor bastard really
didn't have many breaths left." He
looked up at me, his half-open eyes
bloodshot, and yawned.
"You look a little hungover," I
observed.
He closed his eyes. "Well, then I'm
putting up a good front, Pudge, 'cause I'm
actually a lot hungover."
"I kissed Alaska."
"Yeah. I wasn't that drunk. Let's go."
We walked across the dorm circle to
the gym. I sported baggy jeans, a
sweatshirt with no shirt underneath, and
a bad case of bedhead. All the teachers
were in the dorm circle knocking on
doors, but I didn't see Dr. Hyde. I
imagined him lying dead in his house,
wondered who had found him, how they
even knew he was missing before he
failed to show up for class.
"I don't see Dr. Hyde," I told the
Colonel.
"Poor bastard."
The gym was half full by the time we
arrived. A podium had been set up in the
middle of the basketball court, close to
the bleachers. I sat in the second row,
with the Colonel directly in front of me.
My thoughts were split between sadness
for Dr. Hyde and excitement about
Alaska, remembering the up-close sight
of her mouth whispering, "To be
continued?"
And it did not occur to me — not
even when Dr. Hyde shuffled into the
gym, taking tiny, slow steps toward the
Colonel and me.
I tapped the Colonel on the shoulder
and said, "Hyde's here," and the Colonel
said, "Oh shit," and I said, "What?"
and he said, "Where's Alaska?" and I
said, "No," and he said, "Pudge, is she
here or not?" and then we both stood up
and scanned the faces in the gym.
The Eagle walked up to the podium
and said, "Is everyone here?"
"No," I said to him. "Alaska isn't
here."
The Eagle looked down. "Is
everyone else here?"
"Alaska isn't here!"
"Okay, Miles. Thank you."
"We can't start without Alaska."
The Eagle looked at me. He was
crying, noiselessly. Tears just rolled
from his eyes to his chin and then fell
onto his corduroy pants. He stared at me,
but it was not the Look of Doom. His
eyes blinking the tears down his face, the
Eagle looked, for all the world, sorry.
"Please, sir," I said. "Can we please
wait for Alaska?" I felt all of them
staring at us, trying to understand what I
now knew, but didn't quite believe.
The Eagle looked down and bit his
lower lip. "Last night, Alaska Young
was in a terrible accident." His tears
came faster, then. "And she was killed.
Alaska has passed away."
For a moment, everyone in the gym
was silent, and the place had never been
so quiet, not even in the moments before
the Colonel ridiculed opponents at the
free-throw stripe. I stared down at the
back of the Colonel's head. I just stared,
looking at his thick and bushy hair. For a
moment, it was so quiet that you could
hear the sound of not-breathing, the
vacuum created by 190 students shocked
out of air.
I thought: It's all my fault I thought: I
don't feel very good.
I thought: I'm going to throw up.
I stood up and ran outside. I made it
to a trash can outside the gym, five feet
from the double doors, and heaved
toward Gatorade bottles and half-eaten
McDonald's. But nothing much came out.
I just heaved, my stomach muscles
tightening and my throat opening and a
gasping, guttural blech, going through the
motions of vomiting over and over
again. In between gags and coughs, I
sucked air in hard. Her mouth. Her dead,
cold mouth. To not be continued. I knew
she was drunk. Upset. Obviously you
don't let someone drive drunk and pissed
off.
Obviously. And Christ, Miles, what
the hell is wrong with you? And then
comes the puke, finally, splashing onto
the trash. And here is whatever of her I
had left in my mouth, here in this trash
can. And then it comes again, more —
and then okay, calm down, okay,
seriously, she's not dead.
She's not dead. She's alive. She's
alive somewhere. She's in the woods.
Alaska is hiding in the woods and she's
not dead, she's just hiding. She's just
playing a trick on us. This is just an
Alaska Young Prank Extraordinaire. It's
Alaska being Alaska, funny and playful
and not knowing when or how to put on
the brakes.
And then I felt much better, because
she had not died at all.
I walked back into the gym, and
everyone seemed to be in various stages
of disintegration. It was like something
you see on TV, like a National
Geographic special on funeral rituals. I
saw Takumi standing over Lara, his
hands on her shoulders. I saw Kevin
with his crew cut, his head buried
between his knees. A girl named Molly
Tan, who'd studied with us for precalc,
wailed, beating balled fists against her
thighs. All these people I sort of knew
and sort of didn't, and all of them
disintegrating, and then I saw the
Colonel, his knees tucked into his chest,
lying on his side on the bleachers,
Madame O'Malley sitting next to him,
reaching toward his shoulder but not
actually touching it. The Colonel was
screaming. He would inhale, and then
scream. Inhale. Scream. Inhale. Scream.
I thought, at first, that it was only
yelling. But after a few breaths, I noticed
a rhythm. And after a few more, I
realized that the Colonel was saying
words. He was screaming, "I'm so
sorry."
Madame O'Malley grabbed his hand.
"You've got nothing to be sorry for,
Chip. There was nothing you could have
done." But if only she knew.
And I just stood there, looking at the
scene, thinking about her not dead, and I
felt a hand on my shoulder and turned
around to see the Eagle, and I said, "I
think she's playing a dumb prank," and
he said, "No, Miles, no, I'm sorry," and I
felt the heat in my cheeks and said,
"She's really good. She could pull this
off," and he said, "I saw her. I'm sorry."
"What happened?"
"Somebody was setting off
firecrackers in the woods," he said, and
I closed my eyes tight, the ineluctable
fact of the matter at hand: I had killed
her. "I went out after them, and I guess
she drove off campus. It was late. She
was on I-65 just south of downtown. A
truck had jackknifed, blocking both
lanes. A police car had just gotten to the
scene. She hit the cruiser without ever
swerving. I believe she must have been
very intoxicated. The police said they
smelled alcohol."
"How do you know?" I asked.
"I saw her, Miles. I talked to the
police. It was instant. The steering
wheel hit her chest. I'm so sorry."
And I said, you saw her and he said
yes and I said how did she look and he
said, just a bit of blood coming out of
her nose, and I sat down on the floor of
the gym. I could hear the Colonel still
screaming, and I could feel hands on my
back as I hunched forward, but I could
only see her lying naked on a metal
table, a small trickle of blood falling out
of her half-teardrop nose, her green eyes
open, staring off into the distance, her
mouth turned up just enough to suggest
the idea of a smile, and she had felt so
warm against me, her mouth soft and
warm on mine.
The Colonel and I are walking back
to our dorm room in silence. I am staring
at the ground beneath me. I cannot stop
thinking that she is dead, and I cannot
stop thinking that she cannot possibly be
dead. People do not just die.
I can't catch my breath. I feel afraid,
like someone has told me they're going
to kick my ass after school and now it's
sixth period and I know full well what's
coming. It is so cold today — literally
freezing — and I imagine running to the
creek and diving in headfirst, the creek
so shallow that my hands scrape against
the rocks, and my body slides into the
cold water, the shock of the cold giving
way to numbness, and I would stay there,
float down with that water first to the
Cahaba River, then to the Alabama
River, then to Mobile Bay and the Gulf
of Mexico.
I want to melt into the brown,
crunchy grass that the Colonel and I step
on as we silently make our way back to
our room. His feet are so large, too large
for his short body, and the new generic
tennis shoes he wears since his old ones
were pissed in look almost like clown
shoes. I think of Alaska's flip-flops
clinging to her blue toes as we swung on
the swing down by the lake. Will the
casket be open? Can a mortician recreate
her smile? I could still hear her
saying it: "This is so fun, but I'm so
sleepy. To be continued?"
Nineteenth-century preacher Henry
Ward Beecher's last words were "Now
comes the mystery." The poet Dylan
Thomas, who liked a good drink at least
as much as Alaska, said, "I've had
eighteen straight whiskeys. I do believe
that's a record," before dying. Alaska's
favorite was playwright Eugene O'Neill:
"Born in a hotel room, and — God
damnit— died in a hotel room." Even
car-accident victims sometimes have
time for last words. Princess Diana said,
"Oh God. What's happened?" Movie star
James Dean said, "They've got to see
us," just before slamming his Porsche
into another car. I know so many last
words. But I will never know hers.
I am several steps in front of him
before I realize that the Colonel has
fallen down. I turn around, and he is
lying on his face. "We have to get up,
Chip. We have to get up. We just have to
get to the room."
The Colonel turns his face from the
ground to me and looks me dead in the
eye and says, "I. Can't. Breathe."
But he can breathe, and I know this
because he is hyperventilating, breathing
as if trying to blow air back into the
dead. I pick him up, and he grabs onto
me and starts sobbing, again saying, "I'm
so sorry," over and over again.
We have never hugged before, me
and the Colonel, and there is nothing
much to say, because he ought to be
sorry, and I just put my hand on the back
of his head and say the only true thing.
"I'm sorry, too."
two days after
I didn't sleep that night. Dawn was
slow in coming, and even when it did,
the sun shining bright through the blinds,
the rickety radiator couldn't keep us
warm, so the Colonel and I sat
wordlessly on the couch. He read the
almanac.
The night before, I'd braved the cold
to call my parents, and this time when I
said, "Hey, it's Miles," and my mom
answered with, "What's wrong? Is
everything okay?" I could safely tell her
no, everything was not okay. My dad
picked up the line then.
"What's wrong?" he asked.
"Don't yell," my mother said.
"I'm not yelling; it's just the phone."
"Well, talk quieter," she said, and so
it took some time before I could say
anything, and then once I could, it took
some time to say the words in order —
my friend Alaska died in a car crash. I
stared at the numbers and messages
scrawled on the wall by the phone.
"Oh, Miles," Mom said. "I'm so
sorry, Miles. Do you want to come
home?"
"No," I said. "I want to be here…I
can't believe it," which was still partly
true.
"That's just awful," my dad said.
"Her poor parents." Poor parent, I
thought, and wondered about her dad. I
couldn't even imagine what my parents
would do if I died. Driving drunk. God,
if her father ever found out, he would
disembowel the Colonel and me.
"What can we do for you right now?"
my mom asked.
"I just needed you to pick up. I just
needed you to answer the phone, and you
did." I heard a sniffle behind me — from
cold or grief, I didn't know — and told
my parents, "Someone's waiting for the
phone. I gotta go."
All night, I felt paralyzed into
silence, terrorized. What was I so afraid
of, anyway? The thing had happened.
She was dead. She was warm and soft
against my skin, my tongue in her mouth,
and she was laughing, trying to teach me,
make me better, promising to be
continued. And now.
And now she was colder by the hour,
more dead with every breath I took. I
thought: That is the fear: I have lost
something important, and I cannot find
it, and I need it It is fear like if
someone lost his glasses and went to
the glasses store and they told him that
the world had run out of glasses and he
would just have to do without Just
before eight in the morning, the Colonel
announced to no one in particular, "I
think there are bufriedos at lunch today."
"Yeah," I said. "Are you hungry?"
"God no. But she named them, you
know. They were called fried burritos
when we got here, and Alaska started
calling them bufriedos, and then
everyone did, and then finally Maureen
officially changed the name." He paused.
"I don't know what to do, Miles."
"Yeah. I know."
"I finished memorizing the capitals,"
he said.
"Of the states?"
"No. That was fifth grade. Of the
countries. Name a country."
"Canada," I said.
"Something hard."
"Urn. Uzbekistan?"
"Tashkent." He didn't even take a
moment to think. It was just there, at the
tip of his tongue, as if he'd been waiting
for me to say "Uzbekistan" all along.
"Let's smoke."
We walked to the bathroom and
turned on the shower, and the Colonel
pulled a pack of matches from his jeans
and struck a match against the
matchbook. It didn't light. Again, he tried
and failed, and again, smacking at the
matchbook with a crescendoing fury
until he finally threw the matches to the
ground and screamed, "GODDAMN IT!"
"It's okay," I said, reaching into my
pocket for a lighter.
"No, Pudge, it's not," he said,
throwing down his cigarette and standing
up, suddenly pissed. "Goddamn it! God,
how did this happen? How could she be
so stupid! She just never thought
anything through. So goddamned
impulsive. Christ. It is not okay. I can't
believe she was so stupid!"
"We should have stopped her," I
said.
He reached into the stall to turn off
the dribbling shower and then pounded
an open palm against the tile wall.
"Yeah, I know we should have
stopped her, damn it. I am shit sure
keenly aware that we should have
stopped her.
But we shouldn't have had to. You
had to watch her like a three-year-old.
You do one thing wrong, and then she
just dies. Christ! I'm losing it. I'm going
on a walk."
"Okay," I answered, trying to keep
my voice calm.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I feel so
screwed up. I feel like I might die."
"You might," I said.
"Yeah. Yeah. I might. You never
know. It's just. It's like. POOF. And
you're gone."
I followed him into the room. He
grabbed the almanac from his bunk,
zipped his jacket, closed the door, and
POOF. He was gone.
With morning came visitors. An hour
after the Colonel left, resident stoner
Hank Walsten dropped by to offer me
some weed, which I graciously turned
down. Hank hugged me and said, "At
least it was instant. At least there wasn't
any pain."
I knew he was only trying to help,
but he didn't get it. There was pain. A
dull endless pain in my gut that wouldn't
go away even when I knelt on the
stingingly frozen tile of the bathroom,
dry-heaving.
And what is an "instant" death
anyway? How long is an instant? Is it
one second? Ten? The pain of those
seconds must have been awful as her
heart burst and her lungs collapsed and
there was no air and no blood to her
brain and only raw panic. What the hell
i s instant? Nothing is instant. Instant
rice takes five minutes, instant pudding
an hour. I doubt that an instant of
blinding pain feels particularly
instantaneous.
Was there time for her life to flash
before her eyes? Was I there? Was Jake?
And she promised, I remembered, she
promised to be continued, but I knew,
too, that she was driving north when she
died, north toward Nashville, toward
Jake. Maybe it hadn't meant anything to
her, had been nothing more than another
grand impulsivity. And as Hank stood in
the doorway, I just looked past him,
looking across the too-quiet dorm circle,
wondering if it had mattered to her, and I
can only tell myself that of course, yes,
she had promised. To be continued.
Lara came next, her eyes heavy with
swelling. "What happeened?" she asked
me as I held her, standing on my tiptoes
so I could place my chin on top of her
head.
"I don't know," I said.
"Deed you see her that night?" she
asked, speaking into my collarbone.
"She got drunk," I told her. "The
Colonel and I went to sleep, and I guess
she drove off campus." And that became
the standard lie.
I felt Lara's fingers, wet with her
tears, press against my palm, and before
I could think better of it, I pulled my
hand away. "I'm sorry," I said.
"Eet's okay," she said. "I'll be een
my room eef you want to come by." I did
not drop by. I didn't know what to say to
her — I was caught in a love triangle
with one dead side.
That afternoon, we all filed into the
gym again for a town meeting. The Eagle
announced that the school would charter
a bus on Sunday to the funeral in Vine
Station. As we got up to leave, I noticed
Takumi and Lara walking toward me.
Lara caught my eye and smiled wanly. I
smiled back, but quickly turned and hid
myself amid the mass of mourners filing
out of the gym.
I am sleeping, and Alaska flies into
the room. She is naked, and intact. Her
breasts, which I felt only very briefly
and in the dark, are luminously full as
they hang down from her body. She
hovers inches above me, her breath
warm and sweet against my face like a
breeze passing through tall grass.
"Hi," I say. "I've missed you."
"You look good, Pudge."
"So do you."
"I'm so naked," she says, and laughs.
"How did I get so naked?"
"I just want you to stay," I say.
"No," she says, and her weight falls
dead on me, crushing my chest, stealing
away my breath, and she is cold and
wet, like melting ice. Her head is split in
half and a pink-gray sludge oozes from
the fracture in her skull and drips down
onto my face, and she stinks of
formaldehyde and rotting meat. I gag and
push her off me, terrified.
I woke up falling, and landed with a
thud on the floor. Thank God I'm a
bottom-bunk man. I had slept for
fourteen hours. It was morning.
Wednesday, I thought. Her funeral
Sunday. I wondered if the Colonel
would get back by then, where he was.
H e had to come back for the funeral,
because I could not go alone, and going
with anyone other than the Colonel
would amount to alone.
The cold wind buffeted against the
door, and the trees outside the back
window shook with such force that I
could hear it from our room, and I sat in
my bed and thought of the Colonel out
there somewhere, his head down, his
teeth clenched, walking into the wind.
four days after
It was five in the morning and I was
reading a biography of the explorer
Meriwether Lewis (of & Clark fame)
and trying to stay awake when the door
opened and the Colonel walked in.
His pale hands shook, and the
almanac he held looked like a puppet
dancing without strings.
"Are you cold?" I asked.
He nodded, slipped off his sneakers,
and climbed into my bed on the bottom
bunk, pulling up the covers. His teeth
chattered like Morse code.
"Jesus. Are you all right?"
"Better now. Warmer," he said. A
small, ghost white hand appeared from
beneath the comforter. "Hold my hand,
will ya?"
"All right, but that's it. No kissing."
The quilt shook with his laughter.
"Where have you been?"
"I walked to Montevallo."
"Forty miles?!"
"Forty-two," he corrected me. "Well.
Forty-two there. Forty-two back. Eightytwo
miles. No. Eighty-four. Yes. Eightyfour
miles in forty-five hours."
"What the hell's in Montevallo?" I
asked.
"Not much. I just walked till I got too
cold, and then I turned around."
"You didn't sleep?"
"No! The dreams are terrible. In my
dreams, she doesn't even look like
herself anymore. I don't even remember
what she lookedlike."
I let go of his hand, grabbed last
year's yearbook, and found her picture.
In the black-and-white photograph, she's
wearing her orange tank top and cutoff
jeans that stretch halfway down her
skinny thighs, her mouth open wide in a
frozen laugh as her left arm holds
Takumi in a headlock. Her hair falls
over her face just enough to obscure her
cheeks.
"Right," the Colonel said. "Yeah. I
was so tired of her getting upset for no
reason. The way she would get sulky and
make references to the freaking
oppressive weight of tragedy or
whatever but then never said what was
wrong, never have any goddamned
reason to be sad. And I just think you
ought to have a reason. My girlfriend
dumped me, so I'm sad. I got caught
smoking, so I'm pissed off. My head
hurts, so I'm cranky. She never had a
reason, Pudge. I was just so tired of
putting up with her drama. And I just let
her go. Christ."
Her moodiness had annoyed me, too,
sometimes, but not that night. That night I
let her go because she told me to. It was
that simple for me, and that stupid.
The Colonel's hand was so little, and
I grabbed it tight, his cold seeping into
me and my warmth into him. "I
memorized the populations," he said.
"Uzbekistan."
"Twenty-four million seven hundred
fifty-five thousand five hundred and
nineteen."
"Cameroon," I said, but it was too
late. He was asleep, his hand limp in
mine. I placed it back under the quilt and
climbed up into his bed, a top-bunk man
for this night at least. I fell asleep
listening to his slow, even breaths, his
stubbornness finally melting away in the
face of insurmountable fatigue.
six days after
That Sunday,Igot up after three hours
of sleep and showered for the first time
in a long while. I put on my only suit. I
almost hadn't brought it, but my mom
insisted that you never know when
you're going to need a suit, and sure
enough.
The Colonel did not own a suit, and
by virtue of his stature could not borrow
one from anyone at the Creek, so he
wore black slacks and a gray button-
down.
"I don't suppose I can wear the
flamingo tie," he said as he pulled on
black socks.
"It's a bit festive, given the
occasion," I responded.
"Can't wear it to the opera," said the
Colonel, almost smiling.
"Can't wear it to a funeral. Can't use
it to hang myself. It's a bit useless, as
ties go." I gave him a tie.
The school had chartered buses to
ferry students north to Alaska's
hometown of Vine Station, but Lara, the
Colonel, Takumi, and I drove in
Takumi's SUV, taking the back roads so
we didn't have to drive past the spot on
the highway. I stared out the window,
watching as the suburban sprawl
surrounding Birmingham faded into the
slow-sloping hills and fields of northern
Alabama.
Up front, Takumi told Lara about the
time Alaska got her boob honked over
the summer, and Lara laughed. That was
the first time I had seen her, and now we
were coming to the last. More than
anything, I felt the unfairness of it, the
inarguable injustice of loving someone
who might have loved you back but can't
due to deadness, and then I leaned
forward, my forehead against the back of
Takumi's headrest, and I cried,
whimpering, and I didn't even feel
sadness so much as pain. It hurt, and that
is not a euphemism. It hurt like a beating.
Meriwether Lewis's last words
were, "I am not a coward, but I am so
strong. So hard to die." I don't doubt that
it is, but it cannot be much harder than
being left behind. I thought of Lewis as I
followed Lara into the A-frame chapel
attached to the single-story funeral home
in Vine Station, Alabama, a town every
bit as depressed and depressing as
Alaska had always made it out to be.
The place smelled of mildew and
disinfectant, and the yellow wallpaper in
the foyer was peeling at the corners.
"Are y'all here for Ms. Young?" a
guy asked the Colonel, and the Colonel
nodded. We were led to a large room
with rows of folding chairs populated by
only one man. He knelt before a coffin at
the front of the chapel. The coffin was
closed. Closed. Never going to see her
again. Can't kiss her forehead. Can't see
her one last time. But I needed to, I
needed to see her, and much too loud, I
asked, "Why is it closed?" and the man,
whose potbelly pushed out from his tootight
suit, turned around and walked
toward me.
"Her mother," he said. "Her mother
had an open casket, and Alaska told me,
'Don't ever let them see me dead,
Daddy,' and so that's that. Anyway, son,
she's not in there. She's with the Lord."
And he put his hands on my
shoulders, this man who had grown fat
since he'd last had to wear a suit, and I
couldn't believe what I had done to him,
his eyes glittering green like Alaska's but
sunk deep into dark sockets, like a
green-eyed, still-breathing ghost, and
don't no don't don't die, Alaska. Don't
die. And I walked out of his embrace
and past Lara and Takumi to her casket
and knelt before it and placed my hands
on the finished wood, the dark
mahogany, the color of her hair. I felt the
Colonel's small hands on my shoulders,
and a tear dripped onto my head, and for
a few moments, it was just the three of
us — the buses of students hadn't
arrived, and Takumi and Lara had faded
away, and it was just the three of us —
three bodies and two people — the three
who knew what had happened and too
many layers between all of us, too much
keeping us from one another. The
Colonel said, "I just want to save her so
bad," and I said, "Chip, she's gone," and
he said, "I thought I'd feel her looking
down on us, but you're right. She's just
gone," and I said, "Oh God, Alaska, I
love you. I love you," and the Colonel
whispered, "I'm so sorry, Pudge. I know
you did," and I said, "No. Not past
tense." She wasn't even a person
anymore, just flesh rotting, but I loved
her present tense. The Colonel knelt
down beside me and put his lips to the
coffin and whispered, "I am sorry,
Alaska. You deserved a better friend."
Is it so hard to die, Mr. Lewis? Is
that labyrinth really worse than this one?
seven days after
I spent the next day in our room,
playing football on mute, at once unable
to do nothing and unable to do anything
much. It was Martin Luther King Day,
our last day before classes started again,
and I could think of nothing but having
killed her. The Colonel spent the
morning with me, but then he decided to
go to the cafeteria for meat loaf.
"Let's go," he said.
"Not hungry."
"You have to eat."
"Wanna bet?" I asked without
looking up from the game.
"Christ. Fine." He sighed and left,
slamming the door behind him. He's still
very angry, I found myself thinking with
a bit of pity. No reason to be angry.
Anger just distracts from the allencompassing
sadness, the frank
knowledge that you killed her and
robbed her of a future and a life. Getting
pissed wouldn't fix it. Damn it.
"How's the meat loaf?" I asked the
Colonel when he returned.
"About as you remember it. Neither
meaty nor loafy."The Colonel sat down
next to me. "The Eagle ate with me.
He wanted to know if we set off the
fireworks." I paused the game and turned
to him. With one hand, he picked at one
of the last remaining pieces of blue vinyl
on our foam couch.
"And you said?" I asked.
"I didn't rat. Anyway, he said her
aunt or something is coming tomorrow to
clean out her room. So if there's anything
that's ours, or anything her aunt wouldn't
want to find…"
I turned back to the game and said,
"I'm not up for it today."
"Then I'll do it alone," he answered.
He turned and walked outside, leaving
the door open, and the bitter remnants of
the cold snap quickly overwhelmed the
radiator, so I paused the game and stood
up to close the door, and when I peeked
around the corner to see if the Colonel
had entered her room, he was standing
there, just outside our door, and he
grabbed onto my sweatshirt, smiled, and
said, "I knew you wouldn't make me do
that alone. I knew it." I shook my head
and rolled my eyes but followed him
down the sidewalk, past the pay phone,
and into her room.
I hadn't thought of her smell since
she died. But when the Colonel opened
the door, I caught the edge of her scent:
wet dirt and grass and cigarette smoke,
and beneath that the vestiges of vanillascented
skin lotion. She flooded into my
present, and only tact kept me from
burying my face in the dirty laundry
overfilling the hamper by her dresser. It
looked as I remembered it: hundreds of
books stacked against the walls, her
lavender comforter crumpled at the foot
of her bed, a precarious stack of books
on her bedside table, her volcanic
candle just peaking out from beneath the
bed. It looked as I knew it would, but the
smell, unmistakably her, shocked me. I
stood in the center of the room, my eyes
shut, inhaling slowly through my nose,
the vanilla and the uncut autumn grass,
but with each slow breath, the smell
faded as I became accustomed to it, and
soon she was gone again.
"This is unbearable," I said matterof-factly,
because it was.
"God. These books she'll never read.
Her Life's Library."
"Bought at garage sales and now
probably destined for another one."
"Ashes to ashes. Garage sale to
garage sale," I said.
"Right. Okay, down to business. Get
anything her aunt wouldn't want to find,"
the Colonel said, and I saw him kneeling
at her desk, the drawer beneath her
computer pulled open, his small fingers
pulling out groups of stapled papers.
"Christ, she kept every paper she ever
wrote. Moby-Dick. Ethan Frome."
I reached between her mattress and
box spring for the condoms I knew she
hid for Jake's visits. I pocketed them,
and then went over to her dresser,
searching through her underwear for
hidden bottles of liquor or sex toys or
God knows what. I found nothing. And
then I settled on the books, staring at
them stacked on their sides, spines out,
the haphazard collection of literature that
was Alaska. There was one book I
wanted to take with me, but I couldn't
find it.
The Colonel was sitting on the floor
next to her bed, his head bent toward the
floor, looking under her bed frame.
"She sure didn't leave any booze, did
she?" he asked.
And I almost said, She buried it in
the woods out by the soccer field, but I
realized that the Colonel didn't know,
that she never took him to the edge of the
woods and told him to dig for buried
treasure, that she and I had shared that
alone, and I kept it for myself like a
keepsake, as if sharing the memory might
lead to its dissipation.
"Do you see The General in His
Labyrinth anywhere?" I asked while
scanning the titles on the book spines. "It
has a lot of green on the cover, I think.
It's a paperback, and it got flooded, so
the pages are probably bloated, but I
don't think she—" and then he cut me off
with, "Yeah, it's right here," and I turned
around and he was holding it, the pages
fanned out like an accordion from
Longwell, Jeff, and Kevin's prank, and I
walked over to him and took it and sat
down on her bed. The places she'd
underlined and the little notes she'd
written had all been blurred out by the
soaking, but the book was still mostly
readable, and I was thinking I would
take it back to my room and try to read it
even though it wasn't a biography when I
flipped to that page, toward the back: He
was shaken by the overwhelming
revelation that the headlong race
between his misfortunes and his dreams
was at that moment reaching the finish
line. The rest was darkness. "Damn it,"
he sighed. "How will I ever get out of
this labyrinth!"
The whole passage was underlined
in bleeding, water-soaked black ink. But
there was another ink, this one a crisp
blue, post-flood, and an arrow led from
"How will I ever get out of this
labyrinth!" to a margin note written in
her loop-heavy cursive: Straight &
Fast.
"Hey, she wrote something in here
after the flood," I said. "But it's weird.
Look. Page one ninety-two." I tossed the
book to the Colonel, and he flipped to
the page and then looked up at me.
"Straight and fast," he said.
"Yeah. Weird, huh? The way out of
the labyrinth, I guess."
"Wait, how did it happen? What
happened?"
And because there was only one it, I
knew to what he was referring. "I told
you what the Eagle told me. A truck
jackknifed on the road. A cop car
showed up to stop traffic, and she ran
into the cop car. She was so drunk she
didn't even swerve."
"So drunk? So drunk? The cop car
would have had its lights on. Pudge, she
ran into a cop car that had its lights on,"
he said hurriedly. "Straight and fast.
Straight and fast. Out of the labyrinth."
"No," I said, but even as I said it, I
could see it. I could see her drunk
enough and pissed off enough. (About
what — about cheating on Jake? About
hurting me? About wanting me and not
him? Still pissed about ratting out
Marya?) I could see her staring down the
cop car and aiming for it and not giving
a shit about anyone else, not thinking of
her promise to me, not thinking of her
father or anyone, and that bitch, that
bitch, she killed herself.
But no. No. That was not her. No.
She said To be continued. Of course.
"No."
"Yeah, you're probably right," the
Colonel said. He dropped the book, sat
down on the bed next to me, and put his
forehead in his hands. "Who drives six
miles off campus to kill herself? Doesn't
make any sense. But 'straight and fast.'
Bit of an odd premonition, isn't it? And
we still don't really know what
happened, if you think about it.
Where she was going, why. Who
called. Someone called, right, or did I
make—" And the Colonel kept talking,
puzzling it out, while I picked up the
book and found my way to that page
where the general's headlong race came
to its end, and we were both stuck in our
heads, the distance between us
unbridgeable, and I could not listen to
the Colonel, because I was busy trying to
get the last hints of her smell, busy
telling myself that of course she had not
done it. It was me — I had done it, and
so had the Colonel. He could try to
puzzle his way out of it, but I knew
better, knew that we could never be
anything but wholly, unforgivably guilty.
eight days after
Tuesday — we had schoolfor the
first time. Madame O'Malley had a
moment of silence at the beginning of
French class, a class that was always
punctuated with long moments of
silence, and then asked us how we were
feeling.
"Awful," a girl said.
"En francais,"Madame O'Malley
replied. "En francais."
Everything looked the same, but
more still: the Weekday Warriors still
sat on the benches outside the library,
but their gossip was quiet, understated.
The cafeteria clamored with the sounds
of plastic trays against wooden tables
and forks scraping plates, but any
conversations were muted. But more
than the noiselessness of everyone else
was the silence where she should have
been, the bubbling bursting storytelling
Alaska, but instead it felt like those
times when she had withdrawn into
herself, like she was refusing to answer
how or why questions, only this time for
good.
The Colonel sat down next to me in
religion class, sighed, and said, "You
reek of smoke, Pudge."
"Ask me if I give a shit."
Dr. Hyde shuffled into class then,
our final exams stacked underneath one
arm. He sat down, took a series of
labored breaths, and began to talk. "It is
a law that parents should not have to
bury their children," he said. "And
someone should enforce it. This
semester, we're going to continue
studying the religious traditions to which
you were introduced this fall. But there's
no doubting that the questions we'll be
asking have more immediacy now than
they did just a few days ago. What
happens to us after we die, for instance,
is no longer a question of idle
philosophical interest. It is a question
we must ask about our classmate. And
how to live in the shadow of grief is not
something nameless Buddhists,
Christians, and Muslims have to explore.
The questions of religious thought have
become, I suspect, personal."
He shuffled through our exams,
pulling one out from the pile before him.
"I have here Alaska's final. You'll recall
that you were asked what the most
important question facing people is, and
how the three traditions we're studying
this year address that question. This was
Alaska's question."
With a sigh, he grabbed hold of his
chair and lifted himself out of it, then
wrote on the blackboard: How will we
ever get out of this labyrinth of
suf ering?—A. Y.
"I'm going to leave that up for the
rest of the semester," he said.
"Because everybody who has ever
lost their way in life has felt the nagging
insistence of that question. At some point
we all look up and realize we are lost in
a maze, and I don't want us to forget
Alaska, and I don't want to forget that
even when the material we study seems
boring, we're trying to understand how
people have answered that question and
the questions each of you posed in your
papers — how different traditions have
come to terms with what Chip, in his
final, called 'people's rotten lots in life.'"
Hyde sat down. "So, how are you guys
doing?"
The Colonel and I said nothing,
while a bunch of people who didn't
know Alaska extolled her virtues and
professed to be devastated, and at first,
it bothered me. I didn't want the people
she didn't know — and the people she
didn't like — to be sad. They'd never
cared about her, and now they were
carrying on as if she were a sister. But I
guess I didn't know her completely,
either. If I had, I'd have known what
she'd meant by "To be continued?" And
if I had cared about her as I should have,
as I thought I did, how could I have let
her go?
So they didn't bother me, really. But
next to me, the Colonel breathed slowly
and deeply through his nose like a bull
about to charge.
He actually rolled his eyes when
Weekday Warrior Brooke Blakely,
whose parents had received a progress
report courtesy of Alaska, said, "I'm just
sad I never told her I loved her. I just
don't understand why."
"That's such bullshit," the Colonel
said as we walked to lunch. "As if
Brooke Blakely gives two shits about
Alaska."
"If Brooke Blakely died, wouldn't
you be sad?" I asked.
"I guess, but I wouldn't bemoan the
fact I never told her I loved her. I don't
love her. She's an idiot."
I thought everyone else had a better
excuse to grieve than we did — after all,
they hadn't killed her — but I knew
better than to try to talk to the Colonel
when he was mad.
nine days after
"I've got a theory,"the Colonel said
as I walked in the door after a miserable
day of classes. The cold had begun to let
up, but word had not spread to whoever
ran the furnaces, so the classrooms were
all stuffy and overheated, and I just
wanted to crawl into bed and sleep until
the time came to do it all over again.
"Missed you in class today," I noted
as I sat down on my bed. The Colonel
sat at his desk, hunched over a notebook.
I lay down on my back and pulled the
covers up over my head, but the Colonel
was undiscouraged.
"Right, well, I was busy coming up
with the theory, which isn't terribly
likely, admittedly, but it's plausible. So,
listen. She kisses you. That night,
someone calls. Jake, I imagine. They
have a fight — about cheating or about
something else — who knows. So she's
upset, and she wants to go see him. She
comes back to the room crying, and she
tells us to help her get off campus. And
she's freaked out, because, I don't know,
let's say because if she can't go visit him,
Jake will break up with her. That's just a
hypothetical reason. So she gets off
campus, drunk and all pissed off, and
she's furious at herself over whatever it
is, and she's driving along and sees the
cop car and then in a flash everything
comes together and the end to her
labyrinthine mystery is staring her right
in the face and she just does it, straight
and fast, just aims at the cop car and
never swerves, not because she's drunk
but because she killed herself."
"That's ridiculous. She wasn't
thinking about Jake or fighting with Jake.
She was making out with me. I tried to
bring up the whole Jake thing, but she
just shushed me."
"So who called her?"
I kicked off my comforter and, my
fist balled, smashed my hand against the
wall with each syllable as I said, "I!
DON'T! KNOW! And you know
what, it doesn't matter. She's dead. Is the
brilliant Colonel going to figure out
something that's gonna make her less
freaking dead?" But it did matter, of
course, which is why I kept pounding at
our cinder-block walls and why the
questions had floated beneath the surface
for a week. Who'd called? What was
wrong? Why did she leave? Jake had not
gone to her funeral. Nor had he called us
to say he was sorry, or to ask us what
happened. He had just disappeared, and
of course, I had wondered. I had
wondered if she had any intention of
keeping her promise that we would be
continued. I had wondered who called,
and why, and what made her so upset.
But I'd rather wonder than get answers I
couldn't live with.
"Maybe she was driving there to
break up with Jake, then," the Colonel
said, his voice suddenly edgeless. He sat
down on the cornerof my bed.
"I don't know. I don't really want to
know."
"Yeah, well," he said. "I want to
know. Because if she knew what she
was doing, Pudge, she made us
accomplices.
And I hate her for that. I mean, God,
look at us. We can't even talk to anyone
anymore. So listen, I wrote out a game
plan: One. Talk to eyewitnesses. Two.
Figure out how drunk she was. Three.
Figure out where she was going, and
why."
"I don't want to talk to Jake," I said
halfheartedly, already resigned to the
Colonel's incessant planning. "If he
knows, I definitely don't want to talk to
him. And if he doesn't, I don't want to
pretend like it didn't happen."
The Colonel stood up and sighed.
"You know what, Pudge? I feel bad for
you. I do. I know you kissed her, and I
know you're broken up about it. But
honestly, shut up. If Jake knows, you're
not gonna make it any worse. And if he
doesn't, he won't find out. So just stop
worrying about your goddamned self for
one minute and think about your dead
friend. Sorry. Long day."
"It's fine," I said, pulling the covers
back over my head. "It's fine," I
repeated. And, whatever. It was fine. It
had to be. I couldn't afford to lose the
Colonel.
thirteen days after
Because our main source of
vehicular transportation was interred in
Vine Station, Alabama, the Colonel and I
were forced to walk to the Pelham
Police Department to search for
eyewitnesses. We left after eating dinner
in the cafeteria, the night falling fast and
early, and trudged up Highway 119 for a
mile and a half before coming to a
single-story stucco building situated
between a Waffle House and a gas
station.
Inside, a long desk that rose to the
Colonel's solar plexus separated us from
the police station proper, which seemed
to consist of three uniformed officers
sitting at three desks, all of them talking
on the phone.
"I'm Alaska Young's brother," the
Colonel announced brazenly.
"And I want to talk to the cop who
saw her die."
A pale, thin man with a reddish
blond beard spoke quickly into the
phone and then hung up. "I seen 'er," he
said.
"She hit mah cruiser."
"Can we talk to you outside?" the
Colonel asked.
"Yup."
The cop grabbed a coat and walked
toward us, and as he approached, I could
see the blue veins through the translucent
skin of his face. For a cop, he didn't
seem to get out much. Once outside, the
Colonel lit a cigarette.
"You nineteen?" the cop asked. In
Alabama, you can get married at
eighteen (fourteen with Mom and Dad's
permission), but you have to be nineteen
to smoke.
"So fine me. I just need to know
what you saw."
"Ah most always work from six t'
midnight, but I was coverin' the
graveyard shift. We got a call 'bout a
jackknifed truck, and I's only about a
mile away, so I headed over, and I'd just
pulled up. I's still in mah cruiser, and I
seen out the corner a' my eye the
headlights, and my lights was on and I
turned the siren on, but the lights just
kept comin' straight at me, son, and I got
out quick and run off and she just
barreled inta me. I seen plenty, but I ain't
never seen that. She didn't tarn. She
didn't brake. She jest hit it. I wa'n't more
than ten feet from the cruiser when she
hit it. I thought I'd die, but here ah am."
For the first time, the Colonel's
theory seemed plausible. She didn't hear
the siren? She didn't see the lights? She
was sober enough to kiss well, I thought.
Surely she was sober enough to swerve.
"Did you see her face before she hit
the car? Was she asleep?" the Colonel
asked.
"That I cain't tell ya. I didn't see 'er.
There wa'n't much time."
"I understand. She was dead when
you got to the car?" he asked.
"I–I did everything I could. Ah run
right up to her, but the steerin' wheel —
well, ah reached in there, thought if ah
could git that steerin' wheel loose, but
there weren't no gettin' her outta that car
alive. It fairly well crushed her chest,
see."
I winced at the image. "Did she say
anything?" I asked.
"She was passed on, son," he said,
shaking his head, and my last hope of
last words faded.
"Do you think it was an accident?"
the Colonel asked as I stood beside him,
my shoulders slouching, wanting a
cigarette but nervous to be as audacious
as him.
"Ah been an officer here twenty-six
years, and ah've seen more drunks than
you'n count, and ah ain't never seen
someone so drunk they cain't swerve.
But ah don't know. The coroner said it
was an accident, and maybe it was.
That ain't my field, y'know. I s'pose
that's 'tween her and the Lord now."
"How drunk was she?" I asked.
"Like, did they test her?"
"Yeah. Her BAL was point twentyfour.
That's drunk, certainly. That's a
powerful drunk."
"Was there anything in the car?" the
Colonel asked. "Anything, like, unusual
that you remember?"
"I remember them brochures from
colleges — places in Maine and Ohia
and Texas — I thought t' myself that girl
must be from Culver Crick and that was
mighty sad, see a girl like that lookin't'
go t' college. That's a goddamned shame.
And they's flowers. They was flowers in
her backseat. Like, from a florist.
Tulips."
Tulips? I thought immediately of the
tulips Jake had sent her. "Were they
white?" I asked.
"They sure was," the cop answered.
Why would she have taken his tulips
with her? But the cop wouldn't have an
answer for that one.
"Ah hope y'all find out whatever
y'all's lookin' for. I have thought it over
some, 'cause I never seen nothing like
that before. Ah've thought hard on it,
wondered if I'da started up the cruiser
real quick and drove it off, if she'da
been all right. There mightn't've been
time. No knowing now. But it don't
matter, t' my mind, whether it were an
accident or it weren't. It's a goddamned
shame either way."
"There was nothing you could have
done," the Colonel said softly. "You did
your job, and we appreciate it."
"Well. Thanks. Y'all go 'long now,
and take care, and let me know if ya
have any other questions. This is mah
card if you need anything."
The Colonel put the card in his fake
leather wallet, and we walked toward
home.
"White tulips," I said. "Jake's tulips.
Why?"
"One time last year, she and Takumi
and I were at the Smoking Hole, and
there was this little white daisy on the
bank of the creek, and all of a sudden
she just jumped waist-deep into the
water and waded across and grabbed it.
She put it behind her ear, and when I
asked her about it, she told me that her
parents always put white flowers in her
hair when she was little. Maybe she
wanted to die with white flowers."
"Maybe she was going to return them
to Jake," I said.
"Maybe. But that cop just shit sure
convinced me that it might have been a
suicide."
"Maybe we should just let her be
dead," I said, frustrated. It seemed to me
that nothing we might find out would
make anything any better, and I could not
get the image of the steering wheel
careening into her chest out of my mind,
her chest "fairly well crushed" while she
sucked for a last breath that would never
come, and no, this was not making
anything better. "What if she did do it?" I
asked the Colonel. "We're not any less
guilty. All it does is make her into this
awful, selfish bitch."
"Christ, Pudge. Do you even
remember the person she actually was?
Do you remember how she could be a
selfish bitch? That was part of her, and
you used to know it. It's like now you
only care about the Alaska you made
up."
I sped up, walking ahead of the
Colonel, silent. And he couldn't know,
because he wasn't the last person she
kissed, because he hadn't been left with
an unkeepable promise, because he
wasn't me. Screw this, I thought, and for
the first time, I imagined just going back
home, ditching the Great Perhaps for the
old comforts of school friends.
Whatever their faults, I'd never known
my school friends in Florida to die on
me.
After a considerable distance, the
Colonel jogged up to me and said, "I just
want it to be normal again," he said.
"You and me. Normal. Fun. Just,
normal. And I feel like if we knew—"
"Okay, fine," I cut him off. "Fine. We'll
keep looking."
The Colonel shook his head, but then
he smiled. "I have always appreciated
your enthusiasm, Pudge. And I'm just
going to go ahead and pretend you still
have it until it comes back. Now let's go
home and find out why people off
themselves."
fourteen days after
Warning signs of suicide the Colonel
and I found on the Web:
— Previous suicide attempts
Verbally threatening suicide Giving
away prized possessions Collecting and
discussing methods of suicide
— Expressions of hopelessness and
anger at oneself and/or the world
— Writing, talking, reading, and
drawing about death and/or depression
Suggesting that the person would not
be missed if s/he were gone
— Self-injury
— Recent loss of a friend or family
member through death or suicide
— Sudden and dramatic decline in
academic performance
— Eating disorders, sleeplessness,
excessive sleeping, chronic headaches
Use (or increased use) of mind-altering
substances Loss of interest in sex,
hobbies, and other activities previously
enjoyed Alaska displayed two of those
warning signs. She had lost, although not
recently, her mother. And her drinking,
always pretty steady, had definitely
increased in the last month of her life.
She did talk about dying, but she always
seemed to be at least half kidding.
"I make jokes about death all the
time," the Colonel said. "I made a joke
last week about hanging myself with my
tie. And I'm not gonna off myself. So that
doesn't count. And she didn't give
anything away, and she sure as hell
didn't lose interest in sex. One would
have to like sex an awful lot to make out
with your scrawny ass."
"Funny," I said.
"I know. God, I'm a genius. And her
grades were good. And I don't recall her
talking about killing herself."
"Once, with the cigarettes,
remember? 'You smoke to enjoy it. I
smoke to die.'" "That was a joke."
But when prodded by the Colonel,
maybe to prove to him that I could
remember Alaska as she really was and
not just as I wanted her to be, I kept
returning the conversation to those times
when she would be mean and moody,
when she didn't feel like answering how,
when, why, who, o r what questions.
"She could seem so angry," I thought
aloud.
"What, and I can't?" the Colonel
retorted. "I'm plenty angry, Pudge. And
you haven't been the picture of placidity
of late, either, and you aren't going to off
yourself. Wait, are you?"
"No," I said. And maybe it was only
because Alaska couldn't hit the brakes
and I couldn't hit the accelerator.
Maybe she just had an odd kind of
courage that I lacked, but no.
"Good to know. So yeah, she was up
and down — from fire and brimstone to
smoke and ashes. But partly, this year at
least, it was the whole Marya thing.
Look, Pudge, she obviously wasn't
thinking about killing herself when she
was making out with you. After that, she
was asleep until the phone rang. So she
decided to kill herself at some point
between that ringing phone and crashing,
or it was an accident."
"But why wait until you're six miles
off campus to die?" I asked.
He sighed and shook his head. "She
did like being mysterious. Maybe she
wanted it like this." I laughed then, and
the Colonel said, "What?"
"I was just thinking— Why do you
run head-on into a cop car with its
lights on? and then I thought, Weil, she
hated authority figures."
The Colonel laughed. "Hey, look at
that. Pudge made a funny!"
It felt almost normal, and then my
distance from the event itself seemed to
evaporate and I found myself back in the
gym, hearing the news for the first time,
the Eagle's tears dripping onto his pants,
and I looked over at the Colonel and
thought of all the hours we'd spent on
this foam couch in the past two weeks —
everything she'd ruined. Too pissed off
to cry, I said, "This is only making me
hate her. I don't want to hate her. And
what's the point, if that's all it's making
me do?" Still refusing to answer how
and why questions. Still insisting on an
aura of mystery.
I leaned forward, head between my
knees, and the Colonel placed a hand on
my upper back. "The point is that there
are always answers, Pudge." And then
he pushed air out between his pursed
lips and I could hear the angry quiver in
his voice as he repeated, "There are
always answers. We just have to be
smart enough. The Web says that
suicides usually involve carefully
thought-out plans. So clearly she did not
commit suicide." I felt embarrassed to
be still falling apart two weeks later
when the Colonel could take his
medicine so stoically, and I sat up.
"Okay, fine" I answered. "It wasn't
suicide."
"Although it sure doesn't make sense
as an accident," the Colonel said.
I laughed. "We sure are making
progress."
We were interrupted by Holly
Moser, the senior I knew primarily from
viewing her nude self-portraits over
Thanksgiving with Alaska. Holly hung
with the Weekday Warriors, which
explains why I'd previously said about
two words to her in my life, but she just
came in without knocking and said that
she'd had a mystical indicator of
Alaska's presence.
"I was in the Waffle House, and
suddenly all the lights went off, except
for, like, the light over my booth, which
started flashing. It would be like on for a
second and then off for a while and then
on for a couple of seconds and then off.
And I realized, you know, it was Alaska.
I think she was trying to talk to me in
Morse code. But, like, I don't know
Morse code. She probably didn't know
that. Anyway, I thought you guys should
know."
"Thanks," I said curtly, and she stood
for a while, looking at us, her mouth
opening as if to speak, but the Colonel
was staring at her through half-closed
eyes, his jaw jutting out and his distaste
uncontained. I understood how he felt: I
didn't believe in ghosts who used Morse
code to communicate with people they'd
never liked. And I disliked the
possibility that Alaska would give
someone else peace but not me.
"God, people like that shouldn't be
allowed to live," he said after she left.
"It was pretty stupid."
"It's not just stupid, Pudge. I mean, as
if Alaska would talk to Holly Moser.
God! I can't stand these fake grievers.
Stupid bitch."
I almost told him that Alaska
wouldn't want him to call any woman a
bitch, but there was no use fighting with
the Colonel.
twenty days after
It was Sunday,and the Colonel and I
decided against the cafeteria for dinner,
instead walking off campus and across
Highway 119 to the Sunny Konvenience
Kiosk, where we indulged in a wellbalanced
meal of two oatmeal cream
pies apiece. Seven hundred calories.
Enough energy to sustain a man for half a
day. We sat on the curb in front of the
store, and I finished dinner in four bites.
"I'm going to call Jake tomorrow,
just so you know. I got his phone number
from Takumi."
"Fine," I said.
I heard a bell jangle behind me and
turned toward the opening door.
"Y'all's loitering," said the woman
who'd just sold us dinner.
"We're eating," the Colonel
answered.
The woman shook her head and
ordered, as if to a dog, "Git."
So we walked behind the store and
sat by the stinking, fetid Dumpster.
"Enough with the fine's already,
Pudge. That's ridiculous. I'm going to
call Jake, and I'm going to write down
everything he says, and then we're going
to sit down together and try and figure
out what happened."
"No. You're on your own with that. I
don't want to know what happened
between her and Jake."
The Colonel sighed and pulled a
pack of Pudge Fund cigarettes of his
jeans pocket. "Why not?"
"Because I don't want to! Do I have
provide you with an in-depth analysis of
every decision I make?"
The Colonel lit the cigarette with a
lighter I'd paid for and took a drag.
"Whatever. It needs to be figured out,
and I need your help to do it, because
between the two of us we knew her
pretty well. So that's that."
I stood up and stared down at him
sitting smugly, and he blew a thin stream
of smoke at my face, and I'd had enough.
"I'm tired of following orders, asshole!
I'm not going to sit with you and discuss
the finer points of her relationship with
Jake, goddamn it. I can't say it any
clearer: / don't want to know about
them. I already know what she told me,
and that's all I need to know, and you can
be a condescending prick as long as
you'd like, but I'm not going to sit around
and chat with you about how goddamned
much she loved Jake! Now give me my
cigarettes." The Colonel threw the pack
on the ground and was up in a flash, a
fistful of my sweater in his hand, trying
but failing to pull me down to his height.
"You don't even care about her!" he
shouted. "All that matters is you and
your precious fucking fantasy that you
and Alaska had this goddamned secret
love affair and she was going to leave
Jake for you and you'd live happily ever
after. But she kissed a lot of guys, Pudge.
And if she were here, we both know that
she would still be Jake's girlfriend and
that there'd be nothing but drama
between the two of you — not love, not
sex, just you pining after her and her
like, 'You're cute, Pudge, but I love
Jake.' If she loved you so much, why did
she leave you that night?
And if you loved her so much, why'd
you help her go? I was drunk. What's
your excuse?"
The Colonel let go of my sweater,
and I reached down and picked up the
cigarettes. Not screaming, not through
clenched teeth, not with the veins pulsing
in my forehead, but calmly. Calmly. I
looked down at the Colonel and said,
"Fuck you."
The vein-pulsing screaming came
later, after I had jogged across Highway
119 and through the dorm circle and
across the soccer field and down the dirt
road to the bridge, when I found myself
at the Smoking Hole. I picked up a blue
chair and threw it against the concrete
wall, and the clang of plastic on
concrete echoed beneath the bridge as
the chair fell limply on its side, and then
I lay on my back with my knees hanging
over the precipice and screamed. I
screamed because the Colonel was a
self-satisfied, condescending bastard,
and I screamed because he was right, for
I did want to believe that I'd had a secret
love affair with Alaska. Did she love
me? Would she have left Jake for me?
Or was it just another impulsive Alaska
moment? It was not enough to be the last
guy she kissed.
I wanted to be the last one she loved.
And I knew I wasn't. I knew it, and I
hated her for it. I hated her for not caring
about me. I hated her for leaving that
night, and I hated myself, too, not only
because I let her go but because if I had
been enough for her, she wouldn't have
even wanted to leave. She would have
just lain with me and talked and cried,
and I would have listened and kissed at
her tears as they pooled in her eyes.
I turned my head and looked at one
of the little blue plastic chairs on its
side. I wondered if there would ever be
a day when I didn't think about Alaska,
wondered whether I should hope for a
time when she would be a distant
memory — recalled only on the
anniversary of her death, or maybe a
couple of weeks after, remembering only
after having forgotten.
I knew that I would know more dead
people. The bodies pile up. Could there
be a space in my memory for each of
them, or would I forget a little of Alaska
every day for the rest of my life?
Once, early on in the year, she and I
had walked down to the Smoking Hole,
and she jumped into Culver Creek with
her flip-flops still on. She stepped
across the creek, picking her steps
carefully over the mossy rocks, and
grabbed a waterlogged stick from the
creek bank. As I sat on the concrete, my
feet dangling toward the water, she
overturned rocks with the stick and
pointed out the skittering crawfish.
"You boil 'em and then suck the
heads out," she said excitedly.
"That's where all the good stuff is —
the heads."
She taught me everything I knew
about crawfish and kissing and pink
wine and poetry. She made me different.
I lit a cigarette and spit into the
creek. "You can't just make me different
and then leave," I said out loud to her.
"Because I was fine before, Alaska.
I was fine with just me and last words
and school friends, and you can't just
make me different and then die." For she
had embodied the Great Perhaps — she
had proved to me that it was worth it to
leave behind my minor life for grander
maybes, and now she was gone and with
her my faith in perhaps. I could call
everything the Colonel said and did
"fine." I could try to pretend that I didn't
care anymore, but it could never be true
again. You can't just make yourself
matter and then die, Alaska, because
now I am irretrievably different, and I'm
sorry I let you go, yes, but you made the
choice. You left me Perhapsless, stuck in
your goddamned labyrinth. And now I
don't even know if you chose the straight
and fast way out, if you left me like this
on purpose. And so I never knew you,
did I? I can't remember, because I never
knew.
And as I stood up to walk home and
make my peace with the Colonel, I tried
to imagine her in that chair, but I could
not remember whether she crossed her
legs. I could still see her smiling at me
with half of Mona Lisa's smirk, but I
couldn't picture her hands well enough to
see her holding a cigarette. I needed, I
decided, to really know her, because I
needed more to remember. Before I
could begin the shameful process of
forgetting the how and the why of her
living and dying, I needed to learn it:
How. Why. When. Where. What.
At Room 43, after quickly offered
and accepted apologies, the Colonel
said, "We've made a tactical decision to
push back calling Jake. We're going to
pursue some other avenues first."
twenty-one days after
As Dr. Hyde shuffled into class the
next morning, Takumi sat down next to
me and wrote a note on the edge of his
notebook. Lunch at Mclnedible, it read.
I scribbled Okay on my own
notebook and then turned to a blank page
as Dr. Hyde started talking about Sufism,
the mystical sect of Islam. I'd only
scanned through the reading — I'd been
studying only enough not to fail— but in
my scanning, I'd come across great last
words. This poor Sufi dressed in rags
walked into a jewelry store owned by a
rich merchant and asked him, "Do you
know how you're going to die?" The
merchant answered, "No. No one knows
how they're going to die." And the Sufi
said, "I do."
"How?" asked the merchant.
And the Sufi lay down, crossed his
arms, said, "Like this," and died,
whereupon the merchant promptly gave
up his store to live a life of poverty in
pursuit of the kind of spiritual wealth the
dead Sufi had acquired.
But Dr. Hyde was telling a different
story, one that I'd skipped. "Karl Marx
famously called religion 'the opiate of
the masses.' Buddhism, particularly as it
is popularly practiced, promises
improvement through karma. Islam and
Christianity promise eternal paradise to
the faithful. And that is a powerful
opiate, certainly, the hope of a better life
to come. But there's a Sufi story that
challenges the notion that people believe
only because they need an opiate. Rabe'a
al-Adiwiyah, a great woman saint of
Sufism, was seen running through the
streets of her hometown, Basra, carrying
a torch in one hand and a bucket of water
in the other. When someone asked her
what she was doing, she answered, 'I am
going to take this bucket of water and
pour it on the flames of hell, and then I
am going to use this torch to burn down
the gates of paradise so that people will
not love God for want of heaven or fear
of hell, but because He is God.'" A
woman so strong she burns heaven and
drenches hell. Alaska would have liked
this Rabe'a woman, I wrote in my
notebook. But even so, the afterlife
mattered to me. Heaven and hell and
reincarnation. As much as I wanted to
know how Alaska had died, I wanted to
know where she was now, if anywhere. I
liked to imagine her looking down on us,
still aware of us, but it seemed like a
fantasy, and I never really felt it — just
as the Colonel had said at the funeral
that she wasn't there, wasn't anywhere. I
couldn't honestly imagine her as anything
but dead, her body rotting in Vine
Station, the rest of her just a ghost alive
only in our remembering. Like Rabe'a, I
didn't think people should believe in
God because of heaven and hell. But I
didn't feel a need to run around with a
torch. You can't burn down a made-up
place.
After class, as Takumi picked
through his fries at Mclnedible, eating
only the crunchiest, I felt the total loss of
her, still reeling from the idea that she
was not only gone from this world but
from all of them.
"How have you been?" I asked.
"Uh," he said, a mouth full of fries,
"nan good. You?"
"Not good." I took a bite of
cheeseburger. I'd gotten a plastic stock
car with my Happy Meal, and it sat
overturned on the table. I spun the
wheels.
"I miss her,"Takumi said, pushing
away his tray, uninterested in the
remaining soggy fries.
"Yeah. I do, too. I'm sorry, Takumi,"
and I meant it in the largest possible
way. I was sorry we ended up like this,
spinning wheels at a McDonald's. Sorry
the person who had brought us together
now lay dead between us. I was sorry I
let her die. Sorry I haven't talked to you
because you couldn't know the truth
about the Colonel and me, and I hated
being around you and having to
pretend that my grief is this
uncomplicated thing — pretending that
she died and I miss her instead of that
she died because of me.
"Me too. You're not dating Lara
anymore, are you?"
"I don't think so."
"Okay. She was kind of wondering."
I had been ignoring her, but by then
she had begun to ignore me back, so I
figured it was over, but maybe not.
"Well," I told Takumi, "I just can't
— I don't know, man. That's pretty
complicated."
"Sure. She'll understand. Sure. All
good."
"Okay."
"Listen, Pudge. I — ah, I don't know.
It sucks, huh?"
"Yeah."
twenty-seven days after
Six days later four Sundays after the
last Sunday, the Colonel and I were
trying to shoot each other with paintball
guns while turning 900s in a half pipe.
"We need booze. And we need to
borrow the Eagle's Breathalyzer."
"Borrow it? Do you know where it
is?"
"Yeah. He's never made you take
one?"
"Urn. No. He thinks I'm a nerd."
"You are a nerd, Pudge. But you're
not gonna let a detail like that keep you
from drinking." Actually, I hadn't drunk
since that night, and didn't feel
particularly inclined to ever take it up
ever again.
Then I nearly elbowed the Colonel
in the face, swinging my arms wildly as
if contorting my body in the right ways
mattered as much as pressing the right
buttons at the right moments — the same
video-game-playing delusion that had
always gripped Alaska. But the Colonel
was so focused on the game he didn't
even notice. "Do you have a plan for
how, exactly, we're going to steal the
Breathalyzer from inside the Eagle's
house?"
The Colonel looked over at me and
said, "Do you suck at this game?" and
then, without turning back to the screen,
shot my skater in the balls with a blue
paint blast. "But first, we gotta get some
liquor, because the ambrosia's sour and
my booze connection is—"
"POOF.Gone," I finished.
When I opened his door, Takumi
was sitting at his desk, boxy headphones
surrounding his entire head, bouncing his
head to the beat. He seemed oblivious to
us. "Hey," I said. Nothing. "Takumi!"
Nothing. "TAKUMI!" He turned around
and pulled off his headphones. I closed
the door behind me and said, "You got
any alcohol?"
"Why?" he asked.
"Uh, because we want to get drunk?"
the Colonel answered.
"Great. I'll join you."
"Takumi," the Colonel said. "This is
— we need to do this alone."
"No. I've had enough of that shit."
Takumi stood up, walked into his
bathroom, and came out with a Gatorade
bottle filled with clear liquid. "I keep it
in the medicine cabinet," Takumi said.
"On account of how it's medicine."
He pocketed the bottle and then
walked out of the room, leaving the door
open behind him. A moment later, he
peeked his head back in and, brilliantly
mimicking the Colonel's bossy bass
voice, said, "Christ, you comin' or
what?"
"Takumi," the Colonel said. "Okay.
Look, what we're doing is a little
dangerous, and I don't want you caught
up in it. Honestly. But, listen, we'll tell
you everything starting tomorrow."
"I'm tired of all this secret shit. She
was my friend, too."
"Tomorrow. Honestly."
He pulled the bottle out of his pocket
and tossed it to me.
"Tomorrow," he said.
"I don't really want him to know," I
said as we walked back to the room, the
Gatorade bottle stuffed in the pocket of
my sweatshirt.
"He'll hate us."
"Yeah, well, he'll hate us more if we
keep pretending he doesn't exist," the
Colonel answered.
Fifteen minutes later, I stood at the
Eagle's doorstep.
He opened the door with a spatula in
hand, smiled, and said, "Miles, come in.
I was just making an egg sandwich.
Want one?"
"No thanks," I said, following the
Eagle into his kitchen.
My job was to keep him out of his
living room for thirty seconds so the
Colonel could get the Breathalyzer
undetected. I coughed loudly to let the
Colonel know the coast was clear. The
Eagle picked up his egg sandwich and
took a bite. "To what do I owe the
pleasure of your visit?" he asked.
"I just wanted to tell you that the
Colonel — I mean, Chip Martin — he's
my roommate, you know, he's having a
tough time in Latin."
"Well, he's not attending the class,
from what I understand, which can make
it very difficult to learn the language."
He walked toward me. I coughed again,
and backpedaled, the Eagle and I
tangoing our way toward his living
room.
"Right, well, he's up all night every
night thinking about Alaska," I said,
standing up straight and tall, trying to
block the Eagle's view of the living
room with my none-too-wide shoulders.
"They were very close, you know."
"I know that—" he said, and in the
living room, the Colonel's sneakers
squeaked against the hardwood floor.
The Eagle looked at me quizzically and
sidestepped me. I quickly said, "Is that
burner on?" and pointed toward the
frying pan.
The Eagle wheeled around, looked
at the clearly not-on burner, then dashed
into the living room.
Empty. He turned back to me. "Are
you up to something, Miles?"
"No, sir. Honestly. I just wanted to
talk about Chip."
He arched his eyebrows, skeptical.
"Well, I understand that this is a
devastating loss for Alaska's close
friends.
It's just awful. There's no comfort to
this grief, is there?"
"No sir."
"I'm sympathetic to Chip's troubles.
But school is important. Alaska would
have wanted, I'm sure, for Chip's studies
to continue unimpeded."
I'm sure,I thought. I thanked the
Eagle, and he promised me an egg
sandwich at some point in the future,
which made me nervous that he would
just show up at our room one afternoon
with an egg sandwich in hand to find us
A. illegally smoking while the Colonel
B. illegally drank milk and vodka out of
a gallon jug.
Halfway across the dorm circle, the
Colonel ran up to me. "That was smooth,
with the 'Is that burner on?' If you hadn't
pulled that, I was toast. Although I guess
I'll have to start going to Latin. Stupid
Latin."
"Did you get it?" I asked.
"Yeah," he said. "Yeah. God, I hope
he doesn't go looking for it tonight.
Although, really, he could never suspect
anything. Why would someone steal a
Breathalyzer?"
At two o'clock in the morning, the
Colonel took his sixth shot of vodka,
grimaced, then frantically motioned with
his hand toward the bottle of Mountain
Dew I was drinking. I handed it to him,
and he took a long pull on it.
"I don't think I'll be able to go to
Latin tomorrow," he said. His words
were slightly slurred, as if his tongue
were swollen.
"One more," I pleaded.
"Okay. This is it, though." He poured
a sip of vodka into a Dixie cup,
swallowed, pursed his lips, and
squeezed his hands into tight little fists.
"Oh God, this is bad. It's so much better
with milk. This better be point twofour."
"We have to wait for fifteen minutes
after your last drink before we test it," I
said, having downloaded instructions for
the Breathalyzer off the Internet. "Do you
feel drunk?"
"If drunk were cookies, I'd be
Famous Amos."
We laughed. "Chips Ahoy! would
have been funnier," I said.
"Forgive me. Not at my best."
I held the Breathalyzer in my hand, a
sleek, silver gadget about the size of a
small remote control. Beneath an LCD
screen was a small hole. I blew into it to
test it: 0.00, it read. I figured it was
working.
After fifteen minutes, I handed it to
the Colonel. "Blow really hard onto it
for at least two seconds," I said.
He looked up at me. "Is that what
you told Lara in the TV room? Because,
see, Pudge, they only call it a blow job."
"Shut up and blow," I said.
His cheeks puffed out, the Colonel
blew into the hole hard and long, his
face turning red.
"Oh no," the Colonel said. "Oh
God."
"You're two-thirds of the way there,"
I said encouragingly.
"Yeah, but I'm like three-fourths of
the way to puking."
"Well, obviously it's possible. She
did it. C'mon! You can out drink a girl,
can't you?"
"Give me the Mountain Dew," he
said stoically.
And then I heard footsteps outside.
Footsteps. We'd waited till 1:00 to turn
on the lights, figuring everyone would be
long asleep — it was a school night after
all— but footsteps, shit, and as the
Colonel looked at me confused, I
grabbed the Breathalyzer from him and
stuffed it between the foam cushions of
the couch and grabbed the Dixie cup and
the Gatorade bottle of vodka and stashed
them behind the coffee table, and in one
motion I grabbed a cigarette from a pack
and lit it, hoping the smell of smoke
would cover up the smell of booze. I
puffed the cigarette without inhaling,
trying to smoke up the room, and I was
almost back to the couch when the three
quick knocks came against the door and
the Colonel looked at me, his eyes wide,
his suddenly unpromising future flashing
before his eyes, and I whispered, "Cry,"
as the Eagle turned the knob.
The Colonel hunched forward, his
head between his knees and his
shoulders shaking, and I put my arm
around him as the Eagle came in.
"I'm sorry," I said before the Eagle
could say anything. "He's having a tough
night."
"Are you smoking?" the Eagle
asked. "In your room? Four hours after
lights-out?"
I dropped the cigarette into a halfempty
Coke can. "I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
trying to stay awake with him."
The Eagle walked up toward the
couch, and I felt the Colonel start to rise,
but I held his shoulders down firmly,
because if the Eagle smelled the
Colonel's breath we were done for sure.
"Miles," the Eagle said. "I understand
that this is a difficult time for you. But
you will respect the rules of this school,
or you will matriculate someplace else.
I'll see you in Jury tomorrow. Is there
anything I can do for you, Chip?"
Without looking up, the Colonel
answered in a quivering, tear-soaked
voice, "No, sir. I'm just glad I have
Miles."
"Well, I am, too," the Eagle said.
"Perhaps you should encourage him to
live within the confines of our rules, lest
he risk his place on this campus."
"Yes sir," the Colonel said.
"Y'all can leave your lights on until
you're ready to go to bed. I'll see you
tomorrow, Miles."
"Good night, sir," I said, imagining
the Colonel sneaking the Breathalyzer
back into the Eagle's house while I got
harangued at Jury. As the Eagle closed
the door behind him, the Colonel shot
up, smiling at me, and still nervous that
the Eagle might be outside, whispered,
"That was a thing of beauty."
"I learned from the best," I said.
"Now drink."
An hour later, the Gatorade bottle
mostly empty, the Colonel hit. 24.
"Thank you, Jesus!" he exclaimed,
and then added, "This is awful. This is
not fun drunk."
I got up and cleared the coffee table
out of the way so the Colonel could walk
the length of the room without hitting any
obstacles, and said, "Okay, can you
stand?"
The Colonel pushed his arms into the
foam of the couch and began to rise, but
then fell backward onto the couch, lying
on his back. "Spinning room," he
observed. "Gonna puke."
"Don't puke. That will ruin
everything."
I decided to give him a field sobriety
test, like the cops do. "Okay. Get over
here and try to walk a straight line."
He rolled off the couch and fell to
the floor, and I caught him beneath his
armpits and held him up. I positioned
him in between two tiles of the linoleum
floor. "Follow that line of tiles. Walk
straight, toe to heel." He raised one leg
and immediately leaned to the left, his
arms windmilling. He took a single
unsteady step, sort of a waddle, as his
feet were seemingly unable to land
directly in front of each other. He
regained his balance briefly, then took a
step backward and landed on the couch.
"I fail," he said matter-of-factly.
"Okay, how's your depth
perception?"
"My what perwhatshun?"
"Look at me. Is there one of me? Are
there two of me? Could you accidentally
drive into me if I were a cop car?"
"Everything's very spinny, but I don't
think so. This is bad. Was she really like
this?"
"Apparently. Could you drive like
this?"
"Oh God no. No. No. She was really
drunk, huh."
"Yeah."
"We were really stupid."
"Yeah."
"I'm spinning. But no. No cop car. I
can see."
"So there's your evidence."
"Maybe she fell asleep. I feel
awfully sleepy."
"We'll find out," I said, trying to play
the role that the Colonel had always
played for me.
"Not tonight," he answered.
"Tonight, we're gonna throw up a little,
and then we are going to sleep through
our hangover."
"Don't forget about Latin."
"Right. Fucking Latin."
twenty-eight days after
The colonel made it to Latin the next
morning—"I feel awesome right now,
because I'm still drunk. But God help me
in a couple of hours" — and I took a
French test for which I had studied un
petit peu. I did all right on the multiple
choice (which-verb-tense-makes-sensehere
type questions), but the essay
question, In Le Petit Prince, what is the
significance of the rose? threw me a bit.
Had I read The Little Prince in
English or French, I suspect this question
might have been quite easy.
Unfortunately, I'd spent the evening
getting the Colonel drunk. So I
answered, Elle symbolise I'amour ("It
symbolizes love"). Madame O'Malley
had left us with an entire page to answer
the question, but I figured I'd covered it
nicely in three words.
I'd kept up in my classes well enough
to get B-minuses and not worry my
parents, but I didn't really care much
anymore. The significance of the rose? I
thought. Who gives a shit? What's the
significance of the white tulips?
There was a question worth
answering.
After I'd gotten a lecture and ten
work hours at Jury, I came back to Room
43 to find the Colonel telling Takumi
everything — well, everything except
the kiss. I walked in to the Colonel
saying, "So we helped her go."
"You set off the fireworks," he said.
"How'd you know about the
fireworks?"
"I've been doing a bit of
investigating," Takumi answered. "Well,
anyway, that was dumb. You shouldn't
have done it. But we all let her go,
really," he said, and I wondered what
the hell he meant by that, but I didn't
have time to ask before he said to me,
"So you think it was suicide?"
"Maybe," I said. "I don't see how she
could have hit the cop by accident unless
she was asleep."
"Maybe she was going to visit her
father," Takumi said. "Vine Station is on
the way."
"Maybe," I said. "Everything's a
maybe, isn't it?"
The Colonel reached in his pocket
for a pack of cigarettes. "Well, here's
another one: Maybe Jake has the
answers," he said. "We've exhausted
other strategies, so I'm calling him
tomorrow, okay?"
I wanted answers now, too, but not
to some questions. "Yeah, okay," I said.
"But listen — don't tell me anything
that's not relevant. I don't want to know
anything unless it's going to help me
know where she was going and why."
"Me neither, actually," Takumi said.
"I feel like maybe some of that shit
should stay private."
The Colonel stuffed a towel under
the door, lit a cigarette, and said, "Fair
enough, kids. We'll work on a need-toknow
basis."
twenty-nine days after
As I walked home from classes the
next day, I saw the Colonel sitting on the
bench outside the pay phone, scribbling
into a notebook balanced on his knees as
he cradled the phone between his ear
and shoulder.
I hurried into Room 43, where I
found Takumi playing the racing game on
mute. "How long has he been on the
phone?" I asked.
"Dunno. He was on when I got here
twenty minutes ago. He must have
skipped Smart Boy Math. Why, are you
scared Jake's gonna drive down here and
kick your ass for letting her go?"
"Whatever," I said, thinking, This is
precisely why we shouldn't have told
him. I walked into the bathroom, turned
on the shower, and lit a cigarette.
Takumi came in not long after.
"What's up?" he said.
"Nothing. I just want to know what
happened to her."
"Like you really want to know the
truth? Or like you want to find out that
she fought with him and was on her way
to break up with him and was going to
come back here and fall into your arms
and you were going to make hot, sweet
love and have genius babies who
memorized last words and poetry?"
"If you're pissed at me, just say so."
"I'm not pissed at you for letting her
go. But I'm tired of you acting like you
were the only guy who ever wanted her.
Like you had some monopoly on liking
her," Takumi answered. I stood up, lifted
the toilet seat, and flushed my unfinished
cigarette.
I stared at him for a moment, and
then said, "I kissed her that night, and
I've got a monopoly on that."
"What?" he stammered.
"I kissed her."
His mouth opened as if to speak, but
he said nothing. We stared at each other
for a while, and I felt ashamed of myself
for what amounted to bragging, and
finally I said, "I — look, you know how
she was. She wanted to do something,
and she did it. I was probably just the
guy who happened to be there."
"Yeah. Well, I was never that guy,"
he said. "I — well, Pudge, God knows I
can't blame you."
"Don't tell Lara."
He was nodding as we heard the
three quick knocks on the front door that
meant the Eagle, and I thought, Shit,
caught twice in a week, and Takumi
pointed into the shower, and so we
jumped in together and pulled the curtain
shut, the too-low showerhead spitting
water onto us from rib cage down.
Forced to stand closer together than
seemed entirely necessary, we stayed
there, silent, the sputtering shower
slowly soaking our T-shirts and jeans
for a few long minutes, while we waited
for the steam to lift the smoke into the
vents. But the Eagle never knocked on
the bathroom door, and eventually
Takumi turned off the shower. I opened
the bathroom door a crack and peeked
out to see the Colonel sitting on the foam
couch, his feet propped up on thecoffee
table, finishing Takumi's NASCAR race.
I opened the door and Takumi and I
walked out, fully clothed and dripping
wet.
"Well, there's something you don't
see every day," the Colonel said
nonchalantly.
"What the hell?" I asked.
"I knocked like the Eagle to scare
you." He smiled. "But shit, if y'all need
privacy, just leave a note on the door
next time."
Takumi and I laughed, and then
Takumi said, "Yeah, Pudge and I were
getting a little testy, but man, ever since
we showered together, Pudge, I feel
really close to you."
"So how'd it go?" I asked. I sat down
on the coffee table, and Takumi plopped
down on the couch next to the Colonel,
both of us wet and vaguely cold but
more concerned with the Colonel's talk
with Jake than with getting dry.
"It was interesting. Here's what you
need to know: He gave her those
flowers, like we thought. They didn't
fight.
He just called because he had
promised to call at the exact moment of
their eight-month anniversary, which
happened to be three-oh-two in thea.m.,
which — let's agree — is a little
ridiculous, and I guess somehow she
heard the phone ringing. So they talked
about nothing for like five minutes, and
then completely out of nowhere, she
freaked out."
"Completely out of nowhere?"
Takumi asked.
"Allow me to consult my notes." The
Colonel flipped through his notebook.
"Okay. Jake says, 'Did you have a nice
anniversary?' and then Alaska says, "I
had a splendid anniversary,'" and I could
hear in the Colonel's reading the
excitement of her voice, the way she
leaped onto certain words like splendid
and fantastic and absolutely.
"Then it's quiet, then Jake says,
'What are you doing?' and Alaska says,
'Nothing, just doodling,' and then she
says, 'Oh God.' And then she says, 'Shit
shit shit' and starts sobbing, and told him
she had to go but she'd talk to him later,
but she didn't say she was driving to see
him, and Jake doesn't think she was. He
doesn't know where she was going, but
he says she always asked if she could
come up and see him, and she didn't ask,
so she must not have been coming. Hold
on, lemme find the quote." He flipped a
page in the notebook. "Okay, here: "She
said she'd talk to me later, not that she'd
see me.'" "She tells me 'To be continued'
and tells him she'll talk to him later," I
observed.
"Yes. Noted. Planning for a future.
Admittedly inconsistent with suicide. So
then she comes back into her room
screaming about forgetting something.
And then her headlong race comes to its
end. So no answers, really."
"Well, we know where she wasn't
going."
"Unless she was feeling particularly
impulsive," Takumi said. He looked at
me. "And from the sound of things, she
was feeling rather impulsive that night."
The Colonel looked over at me
curiously, and I nodded.
"Yeah," Takumi said. "I know."
"Okay, then. And you were pissed,
but then you took a shower with Pudge
and it's all good. Excellent. So, so that
night…" the Colonel continued.
And we tried to resurrect the
conversation that last night as best we
could for Takumi, but neither of us
remembered it terribly well, partly
because the Colonel was drunk and I
wasn't paying attention until she brought
up Truth or Dare. And, anyway, we
didn't know how much it might mean.
Last words are always harder to
remember when no one knows that
someone's about to die.
"I mean," the Colonel said, "I think
she and I were talking about how much I
adored skateboarding on the computer
but how it would never even occur to me
to try and step on a skateboard in real
life, and then she said, "Let's play Truth
or Dare' and then you fucked her."
"Wait, you fucked her? In front of
the Colonel?" Takumi cried.
"I didn't fuck her."
"Calm down, guys," the Colonel
said, throwing up his hands. "It's a
euphemism."
"For what?" Takumi asked.
"Kissing."
"Brilliant euphemism." Takumi
rolled his eyes. "Am I the only one who
thinks that might be significant?"
"Yeah, that never occurred to me
before," I deadpanned. "But now I don't
know. She didn't tell Jake. It couldn't
have been that important."
"Maybe she was racked with guilt,"
he said.
"Jake said she seemed normal on the
phone before she freaked out," the
Colonel said. "But it must have been that
phone call. Something happened that we
aren't seeing." The Colonel ran his hands
through his thick hair, frustrated. "Christ,
something. Something inside of her. And
now we just have to figure out what that
was."
"So we just have to read the mind of
a dead person," Takumi said. "Easy
enough."
"Precisely. Want to get shitfaced?"
the Colonel asked.
"I don't feel like drinking," I said.
The Colonel reached into the foam
recesses of the couch and pulled out
Takumi's Gatorade bottle. Takumi didn't
want any either, but the Colonel just
smirked and said, "More for me," and
chugged.
thirty-seven days after
The next Wednesday,I ran into Lara
after religion class — literally. I'd seen
her, of course. I'd seen her almost every
day — in English or sitting in the library
whispering to her roommate, Katie. I
saw her at lunch and dinner at the
cafeteria, and I probably would have
seen her at breakfast, if I'd ever gotten
up for it. And surely, she saw me as
well, but we hadn't, until that morning,
looked at each other simultaneously.
By now, I assumed she'd forgotten
me. After all, we only dated for about a
day, albeit an eventful one. But when I
plowed right into her left shoulder as I
hustled toward precalc, she spun around
and looked up at me. Angry, and not
because of the bump. "I'm sorry," I
blurted out, and she just squinted at me
like someone about to either fight or cry,
and disappeared silently into a
classroom. First two words I'd said to
her in a month.
I wanted to want to talk to her. I
knew I'd been awful— Imagine, I kept
telling myself, if you were Lara, with a
dead friend and a silent ex-boy friend
— but I only had room for one true want,
and she was dead, and I wanted to know
the how and why of it, and Lara couldn't
tell me, and that was all that mattered.
forty-five days after
For weeks,the Colonel and I had
relied on charity to support our cigarette
habit — we'd gotten free or cheap packs
from everyone from Molly Tan to the
once-crew-cutted Longwell Chase. It
was as if people wanted to help and
couldn't think of a better way. But by the
end of February, we ran out of charity.
Just as well, really. I never felt right
taking people's gifts, because they did
not know that we'd loaded the bullets
and put the gun in her hand.
So after our classes, Takumi drove
us to Coosa "We Cater to Your Spiritual
Needs" Liquors. That afternoon, Takumi
and I had learned the disheartening
results of our first major precalc test of
the semester. Possibly because Alaska
was no longer available to teach us
precalc over a pile of Mclnedible french
fries and possibly because neither of us
had really studied, we were both in
danger of getting progress reports sent
home.
"The thing is that I just don't find
precalc very interesting," Takumi said
matter-of-factly.
"It might be hard to explain that to
the director of admissions at Harvard,"
the Colonel responded.
"I don't know," I said. "I find it pretty
compelling."
And we laughed, but the laughs
drifted into a thick, pervasive silence,
and I knew we were all thinking of her,
dead and laughless, cold, no longer
Alaska. The idea that Alaska didn't exist
still stunned me every time I thought
about it. She's rotting underground in
Vine Station, Alabama, I thought, but
even that wasn't quite it. Her body was
there, but she was nowhere, nothing,
POOF.
The times that were the most fun
seemed always to be followed by
sadness now, because it was when life
started to feel like it did when she was
with us that we realized how utterly,
totally gone she was.
I bought the cigarettes. I'd never
entered Coosa Liquors, but it was every
bit as desolate as Alaska described. The
dusty wooden floor creaked as I made
my way to the counter, and I saw a large
barrel filled with brackish water that
purported to containlive bait, but in fact
contained a veritable school of dead,
floating minnows. The woman behind
the counter smiled at me with all four of
her teeth when I asked her for a carton of
Marlboro Lights.
"You go t' Culver Creek?" she asked
me, and I did not know whether to
answer truthfully, since no high-school
student was likely to be nineteen, but she
grabbed the carton of cigarettes from
beneath her and put it on the counter
without asking for an ID, so I said, "Yes,
ma'am."
"How's school?" she asked.
"Pretty good," I answered.
"Heard y'all had a death up there."
"Yes'm," I say.
"I's awful sorry t' hear it."
"Yes'm."
The woman, whose name I did not
know because this was not the sort of
commercial establishment to waste
money on name tags, had one long, white
hair growing from a mole on her left
cheek. It wasn't disgusting, exactly, but I
couldn't stop glancing at it and then
looking away.
Back in the car, I handed a pack of
cigarettes to the Colonel.
We rolled down the windows,
although the February cold bit at my face
and the loud wind made conversation
impossible. I sat in my quarter of the car
and smoked, wondering why the old
woman at Coosa Liquors didn't just pull
that one hair out of her mole. The wind
blew through Takumi's rolled-down
window in front of me and against my
face. I scooted to the middle of the
backseat and looked up at the Colonel
sitting shotgun, smiling, his face turned
to the wind blowing in through his
window.
forty-six days after
I didn't want to talk to lara,but the
next day at lunch, Takumi pulled the
ultimate guilt trip. "How do you think
Alaska would feel about this shit?" he
asked as he stared across the cafeteria at
Lara. She was sitting three tables away
from us with her roommate, Katie, who
was telling some story, and Lara smiled
whenever Katie laughed at one of her
own jokes. Lara scooped up a forkful of
canned corn and held it above her plate,
moving her mouth to it and bowing her
head toward her lap as she took the bite
from the fork — a quiet eater.
"She could talk to m e , " I told
Takumi.
Takumi shook his head. His open
mouth gooey with mashed potatoes, he
said, "Yuh ha' to." He swallowed. "Let
me ask you a question, Pudge. When
you're old and gray and your
grandchildren are sitting on your knee
and look up at you and say,
'Grandpappy, who gave you your first
blow job?' do you want to have to tell
them it was some girl you spent the rest
of high school ignoring? No!" He
smiled. "You want to say, 'My dear
friend Lara Buterskaya. Lovely girl.
Prettier than your grandma by a wide
margin.'" I laughed. So yeah, okay. I had
to talk to Lara.
After classes, I walked over to
Lara's room and knocked, and then she
stood in the doorway, looking like,
What?
What now? You've done the damage
you could, Pudge, and I looked past her,
into the room I'd only entered once,
where I learned that kissing or no, I
couldn't talk to her — and before the
silence could get too uncomfortable, I
talked. "I'm sorry," I said.
"For what?" she asked, still looking
toward me but not quite at me.
"For ignoring you. For everything," I
said.
"You deedn't have to be my
boyfriend." She looked so pretty, her big
eyes blinking fast, her cheeks soft and
round, and still the roundness could only
remind me of Alaska's thin face and her
high cheekbones. But I could live with it
— and, anyway, I had to. "You could
have just been my friend," she said.
"I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry."
"Don't forgive that asshole," Katie
cried from inside the room.
"I forgeeve you." Lara smiled and
hugged me, her hands tight around the
small of my back. I wrapped my arms
around her shoulders and smelled
violets in her hair.
"I don't forgive you," Katie said,
appearing in the doorway. And although
Katie and I were not well acquainted,
she felt comfortable enough to knee me
in the balls. She smiled then, and as I
crumpled into a bow, Katie said, "Now I
forgive you."
Lara and I took a walk to the lake —
sans Katie — and we talked. We talked
— about Alaska and about the past
month, about how she had to miss me
and miss Alaska, while I only had to
miss Alaska (which was true enough). I
told her as much of the truth as I could,
from the firecrackers to the Pelham
Police Department and the white tulips.
"I loved her," I said, and Lara said
she loved her, too, and I said, "I know,
but that's why. I loved her, and after she
died I couldn't think about anything else.
It felt, like, dishonest.
Like cheating."
"That's not a good reason," she said.
"I know," I answered.
She laughed softly. "Well, good then.
As long as you know." I knew I wasn't
going to erase that anger, but we were
talking.
As darkness spread that evening, the
frogs croaked and a few newly
resurrected insects buzzed about
campus, and the four of us — Takumi,
Lara, the Colonel, and I — walked
through the cold gray light of a full moon
to the Smoking Hole.
"Hey, Colonel, why do you call eet
the Smoking Hole?" Lara asked. "Eet's,
like, a tunnel."
"It's like fishing hole," the Colonel
said. "Like, if we fished, we'd fish here.
But we smoke. I don't know. I think
Alaska named it." The Colonel pulled a
cigarette out of his pack and threw it into
the water.
"What the hell?" I asked.
"For her," he said.
I half smiled and followed his lead,
throwing in a cigarette of my own. I
handed Takumi and Lara cigarettes, and
they followed suit. The smokes bounced
and danced in the stream for a few
moments, and then they floated out of
sight.
I was not religious, but I liked
rituals. I liked the idea of connecting an
action with remembering. In China, the
Old Man had told us, there are days
reserved for grave cleaning, where you
make gifts to the dead. And I imagined
that Alaska would want a smoke, and so
it seemed to me that the Colonel had
begun an excellent ritual.
The Colonel spit into the stream and
broke the silence. "Funny thing, talking
to ghosts," he said. "You can't tell if
you're making up their answers or if they
are really talking to you."
"I say we make a list," Takumi said,
steering clear of introspective talk.
"What kind of proof do we have of
suicide?" The Colonel pulled out his
omnipresent notebook.
"She never hit the brakes," I said,
and the Colonel started scribbling.
And she was awfully upset about
something, although she'd been awfully
upset without committing suicide many
times before. We considered that maybe
the flowers were some kind of memorial
to herself — like a funeral arrangement
or something. But that didn't seem very
Alaskan to us. She was cryptic, sure, but
if you're going to plan your suicide down
to the flowers, you probably have a plan
as to how you're actually going to die,
and Alaska had no way of knowing a
police car was going to present itself on
I-65 for the occasion.
And the evidence suggesting an
accident?
"She was really drunk, so she could
have thought she wasn't going to hit the
cop, although I don't know how," Takumi
said.
"She could have fallen asleep," Lara
offered.
"Yeah, we've thought about that," I
said. "But I don't think you keep driving
straight if you fall asleep."
"I can't think of a way to find out that
does not put our lives in considerable
danger," the Colonel deadpanned.
"Anyway, she didn't show warning
signs of suicide. I mean, she didn't talk
about wanting to die or give away her
stuff or anything."
"That's two. Drunk and no plans to
die," Takumi said. This wasn't going
anywhere. Just a different dance with the
same question. What we needed wasn't
more thinking. We needed more
evidence.
"We have to find out where she was
going," the Colonel said.
"The last people she talked to were
me, you, and Jake," I said to him. "And
we don't know. So how the hell are we
going to find out?"
Takumi looked over at the Colonel
and sighed. "I don't think it would help,
to know where she was going. I think
that would make it worse for us. Just a
gut feeling."
"Well, my gut wants to know," Lara
said, and only then did I realize what
Takumi meant the day we'd showered
together — I may have kissed her, but I
r e a l l y didn't have a monopoly on
Alaska; the Colonel and I weren't the
only ones who cared about her, and
weren't alone in trying to figure out how
she died and why.
"Well, regardless," said the Colonel,
"we're at a dead end. So one of you think
of something to do. Because I'm out of
investigative tools."
He flicked his cigarette butt into the
creek, stood up, and left. We followed
him. Even in defeat, he was still the
Colonel.
fifty-one days after
The investigation stalled,I took to
reading for religion class again, which
seemed to please the Old Man, whose
pop quizzes I'd been failing consistently
for a solid six weeks. We had one that
Wednesday morning: Share an example
of a Buddhist koan. A koan is like a
riddle that's supposed to help you
toward enlightenment in Zen Buddhism.
For my answer, I wrote about this guy
Banzan. He was walking through the
market one day when he overheard
someone ask a butcher for his best piece
of meat. The butcher answered,
"Everything in my shop is the best. You
cannot find a piece of meat that is not the
best." Upon hearing this, Banzan
realized that there is no best and no
worst, that those judgments have no real
meaning because there is only what is,
a n d poof , he reached enlightenment.
Reading it the night before, I'd wondered
if it would be like that for me — if in
one moment, I would finally understand
her, know her, and understand the role
I'd played in her dying. But I wasn't
convinced enlightenment struck like
lightning.
After we'd passed our quizzes, the
Old Man, sitting, grabbed his cane and
motioned toward Alaska's fading
question on the blackboard. "Let's look
at one sentence on page ninety-four of
this very entertaining introduction to Zen
that I had you read this week.
'Everything that comes together falls
apart,'" the Old Man said. "Everything.
The chair I'm sitting on. It was built,
and so it will fall apart. I'm gonna fall
apart, probably before this chair. And
you're gonna fall apart. The cells and
organs and systems that make you you —
they came together, grew together, and
so must fall apart. The Buddha knew one
thing science didn't prove for millennia
after his death: Entropy increases.
Things fall apart."
We are all going,I thought, and it
applies to turtles and turtlenecks, Alaska
the girl and Alaska the place, because
nothing can last, not even the earth itself.
The Buddha said that suffering was
caused by desire, we'd learned, and that
the cessation of desire meant the
cessation of suffering. When you stopped
wishing things wouldn't fall apart, you'd
stop suffering when they did.
Someday no one will remember that
she ever existed,I wrote in my notebook,
and then, or that I did. Because
memories fall apart, too. And then you're
left with nothing, left not even with a
ghost but with its shadow. In the
beginning, she had haunted me, haunted
my dreams, but even now, just weeks
later, she was slipping away, falling
apart in my memory and everyone else's,
dying again.
The Colonel, who had driven the
Investigation from the start, who had
cared about what happened to her when I
only cared if she loved me, had given up
on it, answerless. And I didn't like what
answers I had: She hadn't even cared
enough about what happened between us
to tell Jake; instead, she had just talked
cute with him, giving him no reason to
think that minutes before, I'd tasted her
boozy breath. And then something
invisible snapped inside her, and that
which had come together commenced to
fall apart.
And maybe that was the only answer
we'd ever have. She fell apart because
that's what happens. The Colonel
seemed resigned to that, but if the
Investigation had once been his idea, it
was now the thing that held me together,
and I still hoped for enlightenment.
sixty-two days after
The next Sunday,I slept in until the
late-morning sunlight slivered through
the blinds and found its way to my face. I
pulled the comforter over my head, but
the air got hot and stale, so I got up to
call my parents.
"Miles!" my mom said before I even
said hello. "We just got caller
identification."
"Does it magically know it's me
calling from the pay phone?"
She laughed. "No, it just says *pay
phone' and the area code. So I deduced.
How are you?" she asked, a warm
concern in her voice.
"I'm doing okay. I kinda screwed up
some of my classes for a while, but I'm
back to studying now, so it should be
fine," I said, and that was mostly true.
"I know it's been hard on you,
buddy," she said. "Oh! Guess who your
dad and I saw at a party last night? Mrs.
Forrester. Your fourth-grade teacher!
Remember? She remembered you
perfectly, and spoke very highly of you,
and we just talked" — and while I was
pleased to know that Mrs. Forrester held
my fourth-grade self in high regard, I
only half listened as I read the scribbled
notes on the white-painted pine wall on
either side of the phone, looking for any
new ones I might be able to decode
(Lacy's — Friday, 10 were the when
and where of a Weekday Warrior party,
I figured)—"and we had dinner with the
Johnstons last night and I'm afraid that
Dad had too much wine. We played
charades and he was just awful." She
laughed, and I felt so tired, but someone
had dragged the bench away from the
pay phone, so I sat my bony butt down
on the hard concrete, pulling the silver
cord of the phone taut and preparing for
a serious soliloquy from my mom, and
then down below all the other notes and
scribbles, I saw a drawing of a flower.
Twelve oblong petals around a filled-in
circle against the daisy-white paint, and
daisies, white daisies, and I could hear
her saying, What do you see, Pudge?
Look, and I could see her sitting drunk
on the phone with Jake talking about
nothing and What are you doing? and
she says, Nothing, just doodling, just
doodling. And then, Oh God.
"Miles?"
"Yeah, sorry, Mom. Sorry. Chip's
here. We gotta go study. I gotta go."
"Will you call us later, then? I'm sure
Dad wants to talk to you."
"Yeah, Mom; yeah, of course. I love
you, okay? Okay, I gotta go."
"I think I found something!" I shouted
at the Colonel, invisible beneath his
blanket, but the urgency in my voice and
the promise of something, anything,
found, woke the Colonel up instantly,
and he jumped from his bunk to the
linoleum. Before I could say anything, he
grabbed yesterday's jeans and sweatshirt
from the floor, pulled them on, and
followed me outside.
"Look." I pointed, and he squatted
down beside the phone and said, "Yeah.
She drew that. She was always doodling
those flowers."
"And 'just doodling,' remember?
Jake asked her what she was doing and
she said 'just doodling,' and then she
said 'Oh God' and freaked out. She
looked at the doodle and remembered
something."
"Good memory, Pudge," he
acknowledged, and I wondered why the
Colonel wouldn't just get excited about
it.
"And then she freaked out," I
repeated, "and went and got the tulips
while we were getting the fireworks.
She saw the doodle, remembered
whatever she'd forgotten, and then
freaked out."
"Maybe," he said, still staring at the
flower, trying perhaps to see it as she
had. He stood up finally and said, "It's a
solid theory, Pudge," and reached up and
patted my shoulder, like a coach
complimenting a player. "But we still
don't know what she forgot."
sixty-nine days after
A week after the discovery of the
doodled flower, I'd resigned myself to
its insignificance — I wasn't Banzan in
the meat market after all — and as the
maples around campus began to hint of
resurrection and the maintenance crew
began mowing the grass in the dorm
circle again, it seemed to me we had
finally lost her.
The Colonel and I walked into the
woods down by the lake that afternoon
and smoked a cigarette in the precise
spot where the Eagle had caught us so
many months before. We'd just come
from a town meeting, where the Eagle
announced the school was going to build
a playground by the lake in memory of
Alaska. She did like swings, I guess, but
a playground? Lara stood up at the
meeting — surely a first for her — and
said they should do something funnier,
something Alaska herself would have
done.
Now, by the lake, sitting on a mossy,
half-rotten log, the Colonel said to me,
"Lara was right. We should do
something for her. A prank. Something
she would have loved."
"Like, a memorial prank?"
"Exactly. The Alaska Young
Memorial Prank. We can make it an
annual event. Anyway, she came up with
this idea last year. But she wanted to
save it to be our senior prank. But it's
good. It's really good. It's historic."
"Are you going to tell me?" I asked,
thinking back to the time when he and
Alaska had left me out of prank planning
for Barn Night.
"Sure," he said. "The prank is
entitled 'Subverting the Patriarchal
Paradigm.'" And he told me, and I have
to say, Alaska left us with the crown
jewel of pranks, the Mona Lisa of highschool
hilarity, the culmination of
generations of Culver Creek pranking.
And if the Colonel could pull it off, it
would be etched in the memory of
everyone at the Creek, and Alaska
deserved nothing less. Best of all, it did
not, technically, involve any expellable
offenses.
The Colonel got up and dusted the
dirt and moss off his pants. "I think we
owe her that."
And I agreed, but still, she owed us
an explanation. If she was up there,
down there, out there, somewhere,
maybe she would laugh. And maybe —
just maybe — she would give us the clue
we needed.
eighty-three days after
Two weeks later,the Colonel
returned from spring break with two
notebooks filled with the minutiae of
prank planning, sketches of various
locations, and a forty-page, two-column
list of problems that might crop up and
their solutions. He calculated all times
to a tenth of a second, and all distances
to the inch, and then he recalculated, as
if he could not bear the thought of failing
her again. And then on that Sunday, the
Colonel woke up late and rolled over. I
was reading The Sound and the Fury,
which I was supposed to have read in
mid-February, and I looked up as I heard
the rustling in the bed, and the Colonel
said, "Let's get the band back together."
And so I ventured out into the overcast
spring and woke up Lara and Takumi,
then brought them back to Room 43. The
Barn Night crew was intact — or as
close as it ever would be — for the
Alaska Young Memorial Prank.
The three of us sat on the couch
while the Colonel stood in front of us,
outlining the plan and our parts in it with
an excitement I hadn't seen in him since
Before. When he finished, he asked,
"Any questions?"
"Yeah," Takumi said. "Is that
seriously going to work?"
"Well, first we gotta find a stripper.
And second Pudge has to work some
magic with his dad."
"All right, then," Takumi said. "Let's
get to work."
eighty-four days after
Every spring,Culver Creek took one
Friday afternoon off from classes, and
all the students, faculty, and staff were
required to go to the gym for Speaker
Day. Speaker Day featured two speakers
— usually small-time celebrities or
small-time politicians or small-time
academics, the kind of people who
would come and speak at a school for
the measly three hundred bucks the
school budgeted. The junior class picked
the first speaker and the seniors the
second, and anyone who had ever
attended a Speaker Day agreed that they
were torturously boring. We planned to
shake Speaker Day up a bit.
All we needed to do was convince
the Eagle to let "Dr. William Morse," a
"friend of my dad's" and a "preeminent
scholar of deviant sexuality in
adolescents," be the junior class's
speaker.
So I called my dad at work, and his
secretary, Paul, asked me if everything
was all right, and I wondered why
eve ryone , e v e r yone , asked me if
everything was all right when I called at
any time other than Sunday morning.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
My dad picked up. "Hey, Miles. Is
everything all right?"
I laughed and spoke quietly into the
phone, since people were milling about.
"Yeah, Dad. Everything is fine. Hey,
remember when you stole the school bell
and buried it in the cemetery?"
"Greatest Culver Creek prank ever,"
he responded proudly.
"It was, Dad. It was. So listen, I
wonder if you'd help out with the new
greatest Culver Creek prank ever."
"Oh, I don't know about that, Miles. I
don't want you getting in any trouble."
"Well, I won't. The whole junior
class is planning it. And it's not like
anyone is going to get hurt or anything.
Because, well, remember Speaker
Day?"
"God that was boring. That was
almost worse than class."
"Yeah, well, I need you to pretend to
be our speaker. Dr. William Morse, a
professor of psychology at the
University of Central Florida and an
expert in adolescent understandings of
sexuality."
He was quiet for a long time, and I
looked down at Alaska's last daisy and
waited for him to ask what the prank
was, and I would have told him, but I
just heard him breathe slowly into the
phone, and then he said, "I won't even
ask. Hmm." He sighed. "Swear to God
you'll never tell your mother."
"I swear to God." I paused. It took
me a second to remember the Eagle's
real name. "Mr. Starnes is going to call
you in about ten minutes."
"Okay, my name is Dr. William
Morse, and I'm a psychology professor,
and — adolescent sexuality?"
"Yup. You're the best, Dad."
"I just want to see if you can top
me," he said, laughing.
Although it killed the Colonel to do
it, the prank could not work without the
assistance of the Weekday Warriors —
specifically junior-class president
Longwell Chase, who by now had grown
his silly surfer mop back. But the
Warriors loved the idea, so I met
Longwell in his room and said, "Let's
go."
Longwell Chase and I had nothing to
talk about and no desire to pretend
otherwise, so we walked silently to the
Eagle's house. The Eagle came to the
door before we even knocked. He
cocked his head a little when he saw us,
looking confused — and, indeed, we
made an odd couple, with Long well's
pressed and pleated khaki pants and my
I-keep-meaning-to-do-laundry blue
jeans.
"The speaker we picked is a friend
of Miles's dad," Longwell said. "Dr.
William Morse. He's a professor at a
university down in Florida, and he
studies adolescent sexuality."
"Aiming for controversy, are we?"
"Oh no," I said. "I've met Dr. Morse.
He's interesting, but he's not
controversial. He just studies the, uh, the
way that adolescents' understanding of
sex is still changing and growing. I
mean, he's opposed to premarital sex."
"Well. What's his phone number?" I
gave the Eagle a piece of paper, and he
walked to a phone on the wall and
dialed. "Yes, hello. I'm calling to speak
with Dr. Morse?…Okay, thanks…Hello,
Dr. Morse. I have Miles Halter here in
my home, and he tells me…great,
wonderful…Well, I was wondering" —
the Eagle paused, twisting the cord
around his finger—"wondering, I guess,
whether you — just so long as you
understand that these are impressionable
young people. We wouldn't want
explicit discussions…. Excellent.
Excellent. I'm glad you understand….
You, too, sir. See you soon!" The Eagle
hung up the phone, smiling, and said,
"Good choice! He seems like a very
interesting man."
"Oh yeah," Longwell said very

one hundred two days
after
My father played Dr. William Morse
on the phone, but the man playing him in
real life went by the name of Maxx with
two x's, except that his name was
actually Stan, except on Speaker Day his
name was, obviously, Dr. William
Morse. He was a veritable existential
identity crisis, a male stripper with more
aliases than a covert CIA agent.
The first four "agencies" the Colonel
called turned us down. It wasn't until we
got to the B's in the "Entertainment"
section of the Yellow Pages that we
found Bachelorette Parties R Us. The
owner of the aforementioned
establishment liked the idea a great deal,
but, he said, "Maxx is gonna love that.
But no nudity.
Not in front of the kids." We agreed
— with some reluctance.
To ensure that none of us would get
expelled, Takumi and I collected five
dollars from every junior at Culver
Creek to cover "Dr. William Morse's"
appearance fee, since we doubted the
Eagle would be keen on paying him after
witnessing the, uh, speech. I paid the
Colonel's five bucks. "I feel that I have
earned your charity," he said, gesturing
to the spiral notebooks he'd filled with
plans.
As I sat through my classes that
morning, I could think of nothing else.
Every junior in the school had known for
two weeks, and so far not even the
faintest rumor had leaked out. But the
Creek was rife with gossipsparticularly
the Weekday Warriors, and if just one
person told one friend who told one
friend who told one friend who told the
Eagle, everything would fall apart.
The Creek's don't-rat ethos
withstood the test nicely, but when
Maxx/Stan/Dr. Morse didn't shown up
by 11:50 that morning, I thought the
Colonel would lose his shit. He sat on
the bumper of a car in the student
parking lot, his head bowed, his hands
running through his thick mop of dark
hair over and over again, as if he were
trying to find something in there. Maxx
had promised to arrive by 11:40, twenty
minutes before the official start of
Speaker Day, giving him time to learn
the speech and everything. I stood next to
the Colonel, worried but quiet, waiting.
We'd sent Takumi to call "the
agency" and learn the whereabouts of
"the performer."
"Of all the things I thought could go
wrong, this was not one of them. We
have no solution for this."
Takumi ran up, careful not to speak
to us until he was near. Kids were
starting to file into the gym. Late late late
late. We asked so little of our performer,
really. We had written his speech. We
had planned everything for him.
All Maxx had to do was show up
with his outfit on. And yet…
"The agency," said Takumi, "says the
performer is on his way."
"On his way?" the Colonel said,
clawing at his hair with a new vigor.
"On his way? He's already late."
"They said he should be—" and then
suddenly our worries disappeared as a
blue minivan rounded the corner toward
the parking lot, and I saw a man inside
wearing a suit.
"That'd better be Maxx," the Colonel
said as the car parked. He jogged up to
the front door.
"I'm Maxx," the guy said upon
opening the door.
"I am a nameless and faceless
representative of the junior class," the
Colonel answered, shaking Maxx's hand.
He was thirtyish, tan and wideshouldered,
with a strong jaw and a
dark, close-cropped goatee.
We gave Maxx a copy of his speech,
and he read through it quickly.
"Any questions?" I asked.
"Uh, yeah. Given the nature of this
event, I think y'all should pay me in
advance."
He struck me as very articulate, even
professorial, and I felt a supreme
confidence, as if Alaska had found the
best male stripper in central Alabama
and led us right to him.
Takumi popped the trunk of his SUV
and grabbed a paper grocery bag with
$320 in it. "Here you go, Maxx," he said.
"Okay, Pudge here is going to sit down
there with you, because you are friends
with Pudge's dad. That's in the speech.
But, uh, we're hoping that if you get
interrogated when this is all over, you
can find it in your heart to say that the
whole junior class called on a
conference call to hire you, because we
wouldn't want Pudge here to get in any
trouble."
He laughed. "Sounds good to me. I
took this gig because I thought it was
hilarious. Wish I'd thought of this in high
school."
As I walked into the gym, Maxx/Dr.
William Morse at my side, Takumi and
the Colonel trailing a good bit behind
me, I knew I was more likely to get
busted than anyone else. But I'd been
reading the Culver Creek Handbook
pretty closely the last couple weeks, and
I reminded myself of my two-pronged
defense, in the event I got in trouble: 1.
There is not, technically, a rule against
paying a stripper to dance in front of the
school. 2. It cannot be proven that I was
responsible for the incident. It can only
be proven that I brought a person onto
campus who I presumed to be an expert
on sexual deviancy in adolescence and
who turned out to be an actual sexual
deviant.
I sat down with Dr. William Morse
in the middle of the front row of
bleachers. Some ninth graders sat behind
me, but when the Colonel walked up
with Lara a moment later, he politely
told them, "Thanks for holding our
seats," and ushered them away. As per
the plan, Takumi was in the supply room
on the second floor, connecting his
stereo equipment to the gym's
loudspeakers. I turned to Dr. Morse and
said, "We should look at each other with
great interest and talk like you're friends
with my parents."
He smiled and nodded his head. "He
is a great man, your father. And your
mother — so beautiful." I rolled my
eyes, a bit disgusted. Still, I liked this
stripper fellow. The Eagle came in at
noon on the nose, greeted the seniorclass
speaker — a former Alabama state
attorney general — and then came over
to Dr. Morse, who stood with great
aplomb and half bowed as he shook the
Eagle's hand — maybe too formal —
and the Eagle said, "We're certainly very
glad to have you here," and Maxx
replied, "Thank you. I hope I don't
disappoint."
I wasn't worried about getting
expelled. I wasn't even worried about
getting the Colonel expelled, although
maybe I should have been. I was
worried that it wouldn't work because
Alaska hadn't planned it. Maybe no
prank worthy of her could be pulled off
without her.
The Eagle stood behind the podium.
"This is a day of historic
significance at Culver Creek. It was the
vision of our founder Phillip Garden that
you, as students and we, as faculty, might
take one afternoon a year to benefit from
the wisdom of voices outside the school,
and so we meet here annually to learn
from them, to see the world as others see
it. Today, our junior-class speaker is Dr.
William Morse, a professor of
psychology at the University of Central
Florida and a widely respected scholar.
He is here today to talk about teenagers
and sexuality, a topic I'm sure you'll find
considerably interesting. So please help
me welcome Dr. Morse to the podium."
We applauded. My heart beat in my
chest like it wanted to applaud, too. As
Maxx walked up to the podium, Lara
leaned down to me and whispered, "He
ees really hot."
"Thank you, Mr. Starnes." Maxx
smiled and nodded to the Eagle, then
straightened his papers and placed them
on the podium. Even I almost believed
he was a professor of psychology. I
wondered if maybe he was an actor
supplementing his income.
He read directly from the speech
without looking up, but he read with the
confident, airy tone of a slightly snooty
academic. "I'm here today to talk with
you about the fascinating subject of
teenage sexuality. My research is in the
field of sexual linguistics, specifically
the way that young people discuss sex
and related questions. So, for instance,
I'm interested in why my saying the word
arm might not make you laugh, but my
saying the word vagina might." And,
indeed, there were some nervous
twitters from the audience. "The way
young people speak about one another's
bodies says a great deal about our
society. In today's world, boys are much
more likely to objectify girls' bodies
than the other way around. Boys will say
amongst themselves that so-and-so has a
nice rack, while girls will more likely
say that a boy is cute, a term that
describes both physical and emotional
characteristics. This has the effect of
turning girls into mere objects, while
boys are seen by girls as whole people
—" And then Lara stood up, and in her
delicate, innocent accent, cut Dr.
William Morse off. "You're so hot! I
weesh you'd shut up and take off your
clothes."
The students laughed, but all of the
teachers turned around and looked at
her, stunned silent. She sat down.
"What's your name, dear?"
"Lara," she said.
"Now, Lara," Maxx said, looking
down at his paper to remember the line,
"what we have here is a very interesting
case study — a female objectifying me,
a male. It's so unusual that I can only
assume you're making an attempt at
humor."
Lara stood up again and shouted,
"I'm not keeding! Take off your clothes."
He nervously looked down at the
paper, and then looked up at all of us,
smiling. "Well, it is certainly important
to subvert the patriarchal paradigm, and
I suppose this is a way. All right, then,"
he said, stepping to the left of the
podium. And then he shouted, loud
enough that Takumi could hear him
upstairs, "This one's for Alaska Young."
As the fast, pumping bass of Prince's
"Get Off" started from the loudspeakers,
Dr. William Morse grabbed the leg of
his pants with one hand and the lapel of
his coat with the other, and the Velcro
parted and his stage costume came apart,
revealing Maxx with two x's, a
stunningly muscular man with an eightpack
in his stomach and bulging pec
muscles, and Maxx stood before us,
smiling, wearing only briefs that were
surely tighty, but not whitey — black
leather.
His feet in place, Maxx swayed his
arms to the music, and the crowd erupted
with laughter and deafening, sustained
applause — the largest ovation by a
good measure in Speaker Day history.
The Eagle was up in a flash, and as soon
as he stood, Maxx stopped dancing, but
he flexed his pec muscles so that they
jumped up and down quickly in time to
the music before the Eagle, not smiling
but sucking his lips in as if not smiling
required effort, indicated with a thumb
that Maxx should go on home, and Maxx
did.
My eyes followed Maxx out the
door, and I saw Takumi standing in the
doorway, fists raised in the air in
triumph, before he ran back upstairs to
cut the music. I was glad he'd gotten to
see at least a bit of the show.
Takumi had plenty of time to get his
equipment out, because the laughing and
talking went on for several minutes
while the Eagle kept repeating, "Okay.
Okay. Let's settle down now. Settle
down, y'all. Let's settle down."
The senior-class speaker spoke next.
He blew. And as we left the gym,
nonjuniors crowded around us, asking,
"Was it you?" and I just smiled and said
no, for it had not been me, or the Colonel
or Takumi or Lara or Longwell Chase or
anyone else in that gym. It had been
Alaska's prank through and through. The
hardest part about pranking, Alaska told
me once, is not being able to confess.
But I could confess on her behalf now.
And as I slowly made my way out of the
gym, I told anyone who would listen,
"No. It wasn't us. It was Alaska."
The four of us returned to Room 43,
aglow in the success of it, convinced that
the Creek would never again see such a
prank, and it didn't even occur to me that
I might get in trouble until the Eagle
opened the door to our room and stood
above us, and shook his head
disdainfully.
"I know it was y'all," said the Eagle.
We look at him silently. He often
bluffed. Maybe he was bluffing.
"Don't ever do anything like that
again," he said. "But, Lord, 'subverting
the patriarchal paradigm'—it's like she
wrote the speech." He smiled and closed
the door.
one hundred fourteen
days after
A week and Ahalf later,I walked
back from my afternoon classes, the sun
bearing down on my skin in a constant
reminder that spring in Alabama had
come and gone in a matter of hours, and
now, early May, summer had returned
for a six-month visit, and I felt the sweat
dribble down my back and longed for
the bitter winds of January. When I got
to my room, I found Takumi sitting on the
couch, reading my biography of Tolstoy.
"Uh, hi," I said.
He closed the book and placed it
beside him and said, "January10."
"What?" I asked.
"January 10. That date ring a bell?"
"Yeah, it's the day Alaska died."
Technically, she died three hours into
January 11, but it was still, to us
anyway, Monday night, January 10.
"Yeah, but something else, Pudge.
January 9. Alaska's mom took her to the
zoo."
"Wait. No. How do you know that?"
"She told us at Barn Night.
Remember?"
Of course I didn't remember. If I
could remember numbers, I wouldn't be
struggling toward a C-plus in precalc.
"Holy shit," I said as the Colonel
walked in.
"What?" the Colonel asked.
"January 9, 1997," I told him.
"Alaska liked the bears. Her mom liked
the monkeys." The Colonel looked at me
blankly for a moment and then took his
backpack off and slung it across the
room in a single motion.
"Holy shit," he said. "WHY THE
HELL DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT!"
Within a minute, the Colonel had the
best solution either of us would ever
come up with. "Okay. She's sleeping.
Jake calls, and she talks to him, and
she's doodling, and she looks at her
white flower, and 'Oh God my mom
liked white flowers and put them in my
hair when I was little,' and then she flips
out. She comes back into her room and
starts screaming at us that she forgot —
forgot about her mom, of course — so
she takes the flowers, drives off campus,
on her way to — what?" He looked at
me. "What? Her mom's grave?"
And I said, "Yeah, probably. Yeah.
So she gets into the car, and she just
wants to get to her mom's grave, but
there's this jackknifed truck and the cops
there, and she's drunk and pissed off and
she's in a hurry, so she thinks she can
squeeze past the cop car, and she's not
even thinking straight, but she has to get
to her mom, and she thinks she can get
past it somehow and POOF."
Takumi nods slowly, thinking, and
then says, "Or, she gets into the car with
the flowers. But she's already missed the
anniversary. She's probably thinking that
she screwed things up with her mom
again — first she doesn't call 911, and
now she can't even remember the
freaking anniversary. And she's furious
and she hates herself, and she decides,
'That's it, I'm doing it,' and she sees the
cop car and there's her chance and she
just floors it."
The Colonel reached into his pocket
and pulled out a pack of cigarettes,
tapping it upside down against thecoffee
table. "Well," he said. "That clears
things up nicely."
one hundred eighteen
days after
So we gave up. I'd finally had
enough of chasing after a ghost who did
not want to be discovered. We'd failed,
maybe, but some mysteries aren't meant
to be solved. I still did not know her as I
wanted to, but I never could.
She made it impossible for me. And
the accicide, the suident, would never be
anything else, and I was left to ask, Did I
help you toward a fate you didn't want,
Alaska, or did I just assist in your
willful self-destruction?
Because they are different crimes,
and I didn't know whether to feel angry
at her for making me part of her suicide
or just to feel angry at myself for letting
her go.
But we knew what could be found
out, and in finding it out, she had made
us closer — the Colonel and Takumi and
me, anyway. And that was it. She didn't
leave me enough to discover her, but she
left me enough to rediscover the Great
Perhaps.
"There's one more thing we should
do," the Colonel said as we played a
video game together with the sound
onjust the two of us, like in the first days
of the Investigation.
"There's nothing more we can do."
"I want to drive through it," he said.
"Like she did."
We couldn't risk leaving campus in
the middle of the night like she had, so
we left about twelve hours earlier, at
3:00 in the afternoon, with the Colonel
behind the wheel of Takumi's SUV. We
asked Lara and Takumi to come along,
but they were tired of chasing ghosts,
and besides, finals were coming.
It was a bright afternoon, and the sun
bore down on the asphalt so that the
ribbon of road before us quivered with
heat. We drove a mile down Highway
119 and then merged onto I-65
northbound, heading toward the accident
scene and Vine Station.
The Colonel drove fast, and we
were quiet, staring straight ahead. I tried
to imagine what she might have been
thinking, trying again to see through time
and space, to get inside her head just for
a moment. An ambulance, lights and
sirens blaring, sped past us, going in the
opposite direction, toward school, and
for an instant, I felt a nervous excitement
and thought, It could be someone I
know. I almost wished it was someone I
knew, to give new form and depth to the
sadness I still felt.
The silence broke: "Sometimes I
liked it," I said. "Sometimes I liked it
that she was dead."
"You mean it felt good?"
"No. I don't know. It felt..pure."
"Yeah," he said, dropping his usual
eloquence. "Yeah. I know. Me, too. It's
natural. I mean, it must be natural."
It always shocked me when I
realized that I wasn't the only person in
the world who thought and felt such
strange and awful things.
Five miles north of school, the
Colonel moved into the left lane of the
interstate and began to accelerate. I
gritted my teeth, and then before us,
broken glass glittered in the blare of the
sun like the road was wearing jewelry,
and that spot must be the spot. He was
still accelerating.
I thought: This would not be a bad
way to go.
I thought: Straight and fast Maybe
she just decided at the last second.
A n d POOF we are through the
moment of her death. We are driving
through the place that she could not drive
through, passing onto asphalt she never
saw, and we are not dead. We are not
dead! We are breathing and we are
crying and now slowing down and
moving back into the right lane.
We got off at the next exit, quietly,
and, switching drivers, we walked in
front of the car. We met and I held him,
my hands balled into tight fists around
his shoulders, and he wrapped his short
arms around me and squeezed tight, so
that I felt the heaves of his chest as we
realized over and over again that we
were still alive. I realized it in waves
and we held on to each other crying and
I thought, God we must look so lame, but
it doesn't much matter when you have
just now realized, all the time later, that
you are still alive.
one hundred nineteen
days after
The colonel and I threw ourselves
into school once we gave up, knowing
that we'd both need to ace our finals to
achieve our GPA goals (I wanted a 3.0
and the Colonel wouldn't settle for even
a 3.98). Our room became Study Central
for the four of us, with Takumi and Lara
over till all hours of the night talking
about The Sound and the Fury and
meiosis and the Battle of the Bulge. The
Colonel taught us a semester's worth of
precalc, although he was too good at
math to teach it very well—"Of course it
makes sense. Just trust me. Christ, it's
not that hard" — and I missed Alaska.
And when I could not catch up, I
cheated. Takumi and I shared copies of
Cliffs Notes for Things Fall Apart and A
Farewell to Arms ("These things are just
too damned long\" he exclaimed at one
point).
We didn't talk much. But we didn't
need to.
one hundred twenty-two
days after
A cool breeze had beaten back the
onslaught of summer, and on the morning
the Old Man gave us our final exams, he
suggested we have class outside. I
wondered why we could have an entire
class outside when I'd been kicked out
of class last semester for merely
glancing outside, but the Old Man
wanted to have class outside, so we did.
The Old Man sat in a chair that
Kevin Richman carried out for him, and
we sat on the grass, my notebook at first
perched awkwardly in my lap and then
against the thick green grass, and the
bumpy ground did not lend itself to
writing, and the gnats hovered. We were
too close to the lake for comfortable
sitting, really, but the Old Man seemed
happy.
"I have here your final exam. Last
semester, I gave you nearly two months
to complete your final paper. This time,
you get two weeks." He paused. "Well,
nothing to be done about that, I guess."
He laughed. "To be honest, I just
decided once and for all to use this
paper topic last night. It rather goes
against my nature. Anyway, pass these
around." When the pile came to me, I
read the question: How will you — you
personally — ever get out of this
labyrinth of suffering? Now that you've
wrestled with three major religious
traditions, apply your newly enlightened
mind to Alaska's question.
After the exams had been passed out,
the Old Man said, "You need not
specifically discuss the perspectives of
different religions in your essay, so no
research is necessary. Your knowledge,
or lack thereof, has been established in
the quizzes you've taken this semester. I
am interested in how you are able to fit
the uncontestable fact of suffering into
your understanding of the world, and
how you hope to navigate through life in
spite of it.
"Next year, assuming my lungs hold
out, we'll study Taoism, Hinduism, and
Judaism together—" The Old Man
coughed and then started to laugh, which
caused him to cough again. "Lord, maybe
I won't last. But about the three
traditions we've studied this year, I'd
like to say one thing. Islam, Christianity,
and Buddhism each have founder figures
— Muhammad, Jesus, and the Buddha,
respectively. And in thinking about these
founder figures, I believe we must
finally conclude that each brought a
message of radical hope. To seventhcentury
Arabia, Muhammad brought the
promise that anyone could find
fulfillment and everlasting life through
allegiance to the one true God. The
Buddha held out hope that suffering
could be transcended. Jesus brought the
message that the last shall be first, that
even the tax collectors and lepers — the
outcasts — had cause for hope. And so
that is the question I leave you with in
this final: What is your cause for hope?"
Back at Room 43, the Colonel was
smoking in the room. Even though I still
had one evening left of washing dishes
in the cafeteria to work off my smoking
conviction, we didn't much fear the
Eagle. We had fifteen days left, and if
we got caught, we'd just have to start
senior year with some work hours. "So
how will we ever get out of this
labyrinth, Colonel?" I asked.
"If only I knew," he said.
"That's probably not gonna get you
an A."
"Also it doesn't do much to put my
soul to rest."
"Or hers," I said.
"Right. I'd forgotten about her." He
shook his head. "That keeps happening."
"Well, you have to write
something," I argued.
"After all this time, it still seems to
me like straight and fast is the only way
out — but I choose the labyrinth. The
labyrinth blows, but I choose it."
one hundred thirty-six
days after
Two weeks later,I still hadn't
finished my final for the Old Man, and
the semester was just twenty-four hours
from ending. I was walking home from
my final test, a difficult but ultimately (I
hoped) successful battle with
precalculus that would win me the Bminus
I so richly desired. It was
genuinely hot out again, warm like she
was.
And I felt okay. Tomorrow, my
parents would come and load up my
stuff, and we'd watch graduation and
then go back to Florida. The Colonel
was going home to his mother to spend
the summer watching the soybeans grow,
but I could call him long-distance, so
we'd be in touch plenty. Takumi was
going to Japan for the summer, and Lara
was again to be driven home via green
limo. I was just thinking that it was all
right not to know quite where Alaska
was and quite where she was going that
night, when I opened the door to my
room and noticed a folded slip of paper
on the linoleum floor. It was a single
piece of lime green stationery. At the
top, it read in calligraphy: From the
Desk of..Takumi Hikohito
Pudge/Colonel: I am sorry that I have
not talked to you before. I am not
staying for graduation. I leave for
Japan tomorrow morning. For a long
time, I was mad at you. The way you cut
me out of everything hurt me, and so I
kept what I knew to myself. But then
even after I wasn't mad anymore, I still
didn't say anything, and I don't even
really know why. Pudge had that kiss, I
guess. And I had this secret.
You've mostly figured this out, but
the truth is that I saw her that night. I'd
stayed up late with Lara and some
people, and then I was falling asleep
and I heard her crying outside my back
window. It was like 3:15 that morning,
maybe, and I walked out there and saw
her walking through the soccer field. I
tried to talk to her, but she was in a
hurry. She told me that her mother was
dead eight years that day, and that she
always put flowers on her mother's
grave on the anniversary, but she
forgot that year. She was out there
looking for flowers, but it was too early
— too wintry. That's how I knew about
January 10. I still have no idea whether
it was suicide.
She was so sad, and I didn't know
what to say or do. I think she counted
on me to be the one person who would
always say and do the right things to
help her, but I couldn't. I just thought
she was looking for flowers. I didn't
know she was going to go. She was
drunk, just trashed drunk, and I really
didn't think she would drive or
anything. I thought she would just cry
herself to sleep and then drive to visit
her mom the next day or something.
She walked away, and then I heard
a car start. I don't know what I was
thinking.
So I let her go, too. And I'm sorry. I
know you loved her. It was hard not to.
Takumi I ran out of the room, like I'd
never smoked a cigarette, like I ran with
Takumi on Barn Night, across the dorm
circle to his room, but Takumi was gone.
His bunk was bare vinyl; his desk empty;
an outline of dust where his stereo had
been. He was gone, and I did not have
time to tell him what I had just now
realized: that I forgave him, and that she
forgave us, and that we had to forgive to
survive in the labyrinth. There were so
many of us who would have to live with
things done and things left undone that
day. Things that did not go right, things
that seemed okay at the time because we
could not see the future. If only we could
see the endless string of consequences
that result from our smallest actions. But
we can't know better until knowing
better is useless.
And as I walked back to give
Takumi's note to the Colonel, I saw that I
would never know. I would never know
her well enough to know her thoughts in
those last minutes, would never know if
she left us on purpose. But the notknowing
would not keep me from caring,
and I would always love Alaska Young,
my crooked neighbor, with all my
crooked heart.
I got back to Room 43, but the
Colonel wasn't home yet, so I left the
note on the top bunk and sat down at the
computer, and I wrote my way out of the
labyrinth: Before I got here, I thought for
a long time that the way out of the
labyrinth was to pretend that it did not
exist, to build a small, self-sufficient
world in a back corner of the endless
maze and to pretend that I was not lost,
but home. But that only led to a lonely
life accompanied only by the last words
of the already-dead, so I came here
looking for a Great Perhaps, for real
friends and a more-than-minor life. And
then I screwed up and the Colonel
screwed up and Takumi screwed up and
she slipped through our fingers. And
there's no sugarcoating it: She deserved
better friends.
When she fucked up, all those years
ago, just a little girl terrified into
paralysis, she collapsed into the enigma
of herself. And I could have done that,
but I saw where it led for her. So I still
believe in the Great Perhaps, and I can
believe in it in spite of having lost her.
Because I will forget her, yes. That
which came together will fall apart
imperceptibly slowly, and I will forget,
but she will forgive my forgetting, just as
I forgive her for forgetting me and the
Colonel and everyone but herself and
her mom in those last moments she spent
as a person. I know now that she
forgives me for being dumb and scared
and doing the dumb and scared thing. I
know she forgives me, just as her mother
forgives her. And here's how I know: I
thought at first that she was just dead.
Just darkness. Just a body being eaten by
bugs. I thought about her a lot like that,
as something's meal. What was her —
green eyes, half a smirk, the soft curves
of her legs — would soon be nothing,
just the bones I never saw. I thought
about the slow process of becoming
bone and then fossil and then coal that
will, in millions of years, be mined by
humans of the future, and how they
would heat their homes with her, and
then she would be smoke billowing out
of a smokestack, coating the atmosphere.
I still think that, sometimes, think that
maybe "the afterlife" is just something
we made up to ease the pain of loss, to
make our time in the labyrinth bearable.
Maybe she was just matter, and matter
gets recycled.
But ultimately I do not believe that
she was only matter. The rest of her must
be recycled, too. I believe now that we
are greater than the sum of our parts. If
you take Alaska's genetic code and you
add her life experiences and the
relationships she had with people, and
then you take the size and shape of her
body, you do not get her. There is
something else entirely. There is a part
of her greater than the sum of her
knowable parts. And that part has to go
somewhere, because it cannot be
destroyed.
Although no one will ever accuse me
of being much of a science student, one
thing I learned from science classes is
that energy is never created and never
destroyed. And if Alaska took her own
life, that is the hope I wish I could have
given her. Forgetting her mother, failing
her mother and her friends and herself
— those are awful things, but she did not
need to fold into herself and self-
destruct. Those awful things are
survivable, because we are as
indestructible as we believe ourselves
to be. When adults say, "Teenagers think
they are invincible" with that sly, stupid
smile on their faces, they don't know
how right they are. We need never be
hopeless, because we can never be
irreparably broken. We think that we are
invincible because we are. We cannot
be born, and we cannot die.
Like all energy, we can only change
shapes and sizes and manifestations.
They forget that when they get old. They
get scared of losing and failing. But that
part of us greater than the sum of our
parts cannot begin and cannot end, and
so it cannot fail.
So I know she forgives me, just as I
forgive her. Thomas Edison's last words
were: "It's very beautiful over there."
I don't know where there is, but I
believe it's somewhere, and I hope it's
beautiful.
