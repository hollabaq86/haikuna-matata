With seventeen syllables
Let's write some haiku

Count your syllables
Make sure you have seventeen
In groups of three lines

The first line has five
The second line has seven
The third line has five

From the ground I creep
Morning dew is new to me
Can't wait for the night

Spring breeze Summer heat
Now, winter chills on my feet
Let alone cold sheets

Christmas is coming
A time of joy, peace and love
Warmest of wishes

No Christmas madness
Here it is calm just one gift
The rest had their turn

Wonderful haiku!
Hustle and bustle begins
Gift wrapping awaits

I will buy some sweets
Just not into the baking
Love to eat it though!

Festive time for all
Don't forget the ones alone
Surprise and treat them

Four days time off for
Family and friends to see
Work on art a must


Merry Christmas Eve
Time well spent with family
Blessings to you all

Merry Christmas Day
White blanket of snow did fall
It's a White Christmas

Wishing on a star
Happy Holidays to All
Brightest New Year too

Wow you made all that!
Very creative I'd say
Congratulations!

Awake before dawn
Enjoying still darkness
Birds still sleeping sound

Misty morning moon
Venus takes her place in time
Silhouette shadows

Spent all night crying
Watched my cat die this morning
New Year starts off bad

Her spirit remains
Little boy's heart is broken
They were true best friends

We will bury her
In their special secret place
Where she'll play all day

She'll remain with us
Around us and among us
Never forgotten

I am so sorry
For the loss of your kitty
Memories remain

The tiny creatures
Can fill our hearts with such joy
Makes parting so hard

Weary wanderer
Muse takes flight into the night
Faint shadows follow

Shadows unworthy
Their bodies to earth be bound
No eyes, no ears found

Your light does not shine
Your shadow, one can not find
Darkness swallows you

my male cats miss her
no queen to boss them around
she was half their size

Not that I can see
Springs are longer and cooler
I like it warmer

Lilacs are in bloom
Their smell permeates the room
Intoxicating!

eyes closed, i see you
no image of form intrudes
to spoil the surprise

I sat here so long
You were so very quiet
I thought you were gone

the grey men beckon
lacking subtlety I fall
for their promises

deep sea dance and play
magnificence multiplied
beauty magnified

The snake twines
around the branch
my breath freezes

it's guilty conscience
you'll have to behave yourself
only then you'll sleep

Today is so cold
Ice melting on tarmac
Fly me to the sun

A full moon tonight
Affects people's reasoning
Car wrecks abounding

Eclipse was imminent
Early in the morning time
Hope no clouds to hide

Not another wreck
A couple of close calls though
Think I'll take the bus.

Glorious Christmas
Now The New Year Has Begun
Life Renewed For All

frogs steal the chill night
until their peace is stolen
silence, then, complete

She's the cat's meow
Catches mice and earns her keep
She's the dog's Bow-Wow!

Empty canvas waits
Longingly and forlornly
Before my window

Let's hear it for orange!
The color of fall pumpkins
And year-round sunsets.

Halloween's coming
I am wearing my costume
Time to ride my broom

Call it a day, sure
Call it a night, if I must
Call it whatever

Christmas is coming
I don't want to celebrate
Glad when it's over

I do not blame you
Hope that it brings joy and peace
Of chocolate cake

Haiku makes no sense
It's fun to do anyway
Here's to idiots

Where will it all end
We now write compulsively
Doomed to endless verse

Thunder frightens me
More than an explosive whale
Laying on the beach

surrender, he sighed
as she stretched the length of him
in her arms, melted

wind sings her to sleep
But Moon has other ideas
she can only dance

The man on the moon
Broke free and followed a dream
The sun said nothing

Earthling astronaut
On one-way ticket to Mars
Sings Red Planet blues

Sweet tender moments
Remind me of blue waters
And ever lasting scents

Fly to me sweet bird
For I shall keep you ever safe
From demons and fireflies

Paint oil on canvas
Add some more before it dries
Look you have made mud

Let there be free drinks
Tuesdays in the Speakeasy!
(Bring your own bottle.)

That sounds great, I'm in.
Sounds like a bunch of drunkards
Can we share bottles

We'll paint the town red
paint ourselves into corners
sleep on the drop cloths . . .

Sounds like a fun crowd
What point do we call the law?
And who'll bail us out?

Nightlife behind bars
swinging from the chandeliers
who wants to get out?

The sky is so blue.
The sun is so warm up high.
I love the summer.

I really like toast.
It is yummy when it's hot.
I like it best cold.

The last winter leaves
Clinging to the black branches
Explode into birds.

Slowly, graceful wings
Lift skyward; as you lift me
Friends always, grateful

That quenches my thirst
Ocean vast and beautiful
But she is salty

Sick, though I love her
even though she always lies
cherishing my bones.

The pond, blue, round, fresh
The frog jumps, breaking surface
In and wet he is

Just look at the moon
So big and round; trustworthy
Guarding us at night.

Fallen autumn leaves;
Dancing around with the wind;
Tells us, “Summer’s gone!”

Funny silly boy
with spiky bouncy brown hair
and two brave brothers

Dreary winter rain
as the funeral bell tolls
Doves fly to heaven

Last Book Purchased
Rolling from class to class
Welcome to College

I should have money
My tired heart bleeds out on you
Love, you're my job

the clouds cry
packs of women passing by
train horn sounds

One small piece of heart
is mended in a moment.
Rain falls, tears of joy.

Fire begins to burn
In the truck red lights and horns
Pull the hose and douse flames

Light breeze rustles leaves
As birds share their souls through song
I listen from bed

Throbbing with passion,
my lover's heart quests for you,
though, still fast asleep.

Blossoms hint of love,
Strong roots harden life love care,
Blossoms touch my soul.

tears fall down slowly
the chord is cut precisly
new words come to life

My friends are like gold.
They are precious and worth it.
I love them to bits.

My green Chinese plant
The leaves went brown and withered
The plant had no roots

I look up and see
white clouds surround the mountains
right before my eyes.

Drinking mouths
stale with yesterday’s beer.
Cat wants to come in.

Pounding in the head
Want dark and quiet solace
Relief is wanting

Time is a loner,
Whom we may seek hopelessly
Shuns our company.

a snow filled window
cloaked eyes with sheer blanket
someday I will see

First morning sunshine
On my silver fur and whiskers
Makes my silhouette.

Snowflakes are our friends,
They descend when winter comes,
Making white blankets.

The Olympics come
Watch them compete in events
Hear the mighty roar

Summer heat melts me
Love comes quickly with laughter
Soft sweet snuggles help

Standing on the track
Watching the crowd stand and cheer
The pistol goes off

On her birthday this summer
I took her to watch the sea
how it kisses the shore

She opened her arms
Looked at me with hope, I had
No change to give her

I don't like my dog
white fluffy and too needy
Yet he's all I have

On summer thermals
A hawk circles in silence
Below, a mouse rears.

A million diamonds
shining from frosted rooftops.
Sun piercing my eyes.

Sad pink snow falling
Cherry blossom in the spring.
Sun so weak and cold.

Beach weather again,
spread the lotion, cover up.
Sun so strong it burns.

Preparing for rest
green leaves are golden and red.
Sun gentle and warm.

Ripples, reflections
Karma, consider the source
Mirrored back at you.

Sunshine on one side
Magical arch other side
hope promise healing!

mountains that are high
birds that we see on the sky
never let them die.

Rain, it softly falls
Trees thirst and drink greedily
The forest sings out!

Proud fearless master
Courageous instinctive free
Paws that mark the earth

Constantly wind blows
Native State and Sooner State
Crossroads of our home

Landscape of oil rigs
Seas of green, flatlands and hills
Cattle eating grass

Tornado Alley
Falling leaves,trees and debris
Spring, Summer and Fall

Many trails of tears
The forced movement of many
Remember them all

Constantly wind blows
Native State and Sooner State
Crossroads of us all

Remorseless spring sun
Curtains separate the room
Voices are absent

Love has enjoyment
And love has disappointment
It changes your life

Wind dancing the trees
While singing into the woods
Oh, what a wonder

Foaming white horses
rolling in collapse on dunes
look a jellyfish

She's the unwanted,
Waiting alone once more,
No more tears will fall.

Mountains with snow tops
You smell the rain in the air
"Boom" is what you hear

Crack in the asphalt
Breaking the monotony
of the big city life.

Partners in our faith
Our flight to Heaven is sure
Prayer gives us our wings

Ocean waves thunder
Washing away my footprints
And leaving seashells

My life is unique
Never give up on myself,
It's all up to me

Dust bunnies growing
Vacuum cleaner has broken
Violent Allergies

Summer winds flow in
The green mountains are silent
The brook babbles joy

The rain is falling
nourishing the earth with love
glad you are a friend

Crispy, colorful
Descending rainbows hurry
To the ground below

Swaying gracefully
As the wind whispers gently
Carpet of the earth

Sphere of fire and light
Dispels darkness and makes life
Seem incandescent

Sunday is church day
Pastor read from the bible
Children sing a song

What is change to you?
Is it something that you feel,
or something you do?

Sheep graze lazily
The grass is long lush and green
Shearing time is soon

Escape from your mind
Breathe in the light around you
Sweat falls like raindrops

Flowers blossom now
Exploding with their colour
Robins making nest

He worked hard always
He loved us and the Lord God
He sings in heaven

Part of heavens choir
A baritone voice rings out
Clouds cry at the sound

He is part of God
His spirit soars on and on
Tears of loss and joy

Oh, my father, Dad
Your son is treading onward
Father, oh, FATHER

Wind hissed in my ear
Oh God! what a solid fear
When the fall is here

Summer sweltering
It soaks my skin through and through
No rivers flooding


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sudden hail--
the argument breaks off
mid-sentence

sudden hail--
she tells me to be careful
what I wish for

distant thunder--
I dream I've forgotten
where my parents live

first frost--
the squirrel plants acorns
where we buried the cat

the scent
not the flower
is driving me crazy

first dew touch-
shlyly, the lily unfolds
her petals

still wandering...
over fields of chysanthemum
my old dream of love

the eagle's wing
understands well-
the language of wind

that full moon-
a coin falls into
the beggar's palm

strutting-
behind his shadow
a rooster

fluttering
in the spider's web
may fly

waiting for the moon
to defeat that cloud
the lonely tree

in the wilderness
I found out:
love is green

sparrows go
behind the hill singing of
lost identitiy

I m hungry for you-
the sea whispered to the
subtle fish

a stone frog
in the public garden -
wondering who I am...!

in the river,
the moon and the star-
hugging

misty windows-
lingering on the lips
the taste of pink

after a
long night...
the morning glory

lying as a cradle
watching christmas stars-
cresent moon

Over the wintry forest,
winds howl in rage
with no leaves to blow.

An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond, splash!
Silence again.

Whitecaps on the bay;
A broken signboard banging
In the April wind.

pilgrim counts
every second step
stone in shoe

sugar for the tea
behind the bowl
a line of ants

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

this spring's fragrance
were it a woman I'd
follow wherever

another test
another doctor visit
long winter nights

the colour of wind
through pine trees
must be blue

incense lit
the scent of sage
lingers in a crowd

Autumn moonlight—
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

Lightning flash—
what I thought were faces
are plumes of pampas grass.

I hear crackling
Crunch, of today’s new found day
And know it won’t last

Falling to the ground,
I watch a leaf settle down
In a bed of brown.

A cricket disturbed
the sleeping child; on the porch
a man smoked and smiled.

I'm turning over
look out and give me room there
you cricket, you.

In the cicada's cry
No sign can tell
How soon it must die.

First day of Spring-
I keep thinking about-
the end of autmn.

Wake, butterfly
it's late-
we've miles to go together.

Moonless night...
a powerful wind embraces
the ancient cedars.

Don't imitate me;
it's as boring
as the two halves of a melon.

The moon so pure
a wandering monk carries it
across the sand.

Night; and once again,
the while I wait for you, cold wind
turns into rain.

I want to sleep
Swat the flies
Softly, please.

When I turned my head
That traveller I'd just passed...
Melted in the mist.

My life -
How much more of it remains?
The night is brief.

My grumbling wife -
if only she were here!
this moon tonight...

A lovely thing to see:
through the paper window's hole,
the Galaxy.

The first firefly...
But he got away and I...
Air in my fingers.

In this world
we walk on the roof of hell,
gazing at flowers.

After killing
a spider, how lonely I feel
in the cold of night!

No sky
no earth - but still
snowflakes fall.

An autumn eve;
There is joy too,
In loneliness.

My arm for a pillow,
I really like myself
under the hazy moon.

The end of spring-
the poet is brooding
about editors.

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

Experimenting...
I hung the moon on various
branches of the pine

First autumn morning
the mirror I stare into
shows my father's face.

moon in the cold -
only my own footsteps
on the bridge.

A firefly flitted by:
"Look!" I almost said
but I was alone.

Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still...
Iris, blue each spring.

A giant firefly:
That way, this way, that way, this -
and it passes by.

Following the train,
The long black smoke is crawling
Over the withered plain.

In pale moonlight
the wisteria's scent
comes from far away.

Snow whispering down
All day long earth has vanished
Leaving only sky.

In all this cool
is the moon also sleeping?
There, in the pool?

The winds that blow-
ask them, which leaf on the tree
will be next to go.

How I long to see
among dawn flowers,
the face of God.

Don't weep, insects -
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

Icicles and water
Old differences dissolved...
Drip down together

I kill an ant
and realize my three children
have been watching.

Starting to call you
Come watch these butterflies . . .
Oh! I'm all alone

A harsh-rasping saw...
music of cold-poverty
in the winter midnight

Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still...
Iris, blue each spring

A gold bug -
I hurl into the darkness
and feel the depth of night

Fallen sick on a journey,
In dreams I run wildly
Over a withered moor.

Covered with the flowers,
Instantly I'd like to die
In this dream of ours!

not a fairytale -
sunlight turns
yellow leaves into gold

conductor's baton
a bumble bee
busy at work

Do not trust your eyes
There is danger in disguise
Beauty has two faces

Don't weep, insects –
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

They end their flight
one by one–
crows at dusk

In all this cool
is the moon also sleeping?
There, in the pool?

Night, and the moon!
My neighbor, playing on his flute -
out of tune!

Grasses wilt:
the braking locomotive
grinds to a halt.

While you decline to cry,
high on the mountainside
a single stalk of plumegrass wilts.

Hush, cawing birds; what rackets you make:
heaven's indignant messengers ...
you remind me of wordsmiths!

Onyx, this gem-black night.
Downcast, I await your return
like the morning sun, unrivaled in splendor.

Snow-obscured heights;
mist-shrouded slopes:
this spring evening.

An orphaned blossom
returning to its bough, somehow?
No, a solitary butterfly.

This darkening autumn:
my neighbor,
how does he continue?

Lightning
shatters the darkness―
the night heron's shriek

An ancient pond,
the frog leaps:
the silver plop and gurgle of water.

My eyes,
having observed everything,
returned to the white chrysanthemums.

Useless dreams, alas!
Over desolate fields
winds whisper as they pass.

Observe:
see how the wild violets bloom
within the forbidden fences!


A kite floats
at the same place in the sky
where yesterday it floated ...

Snow in my shoe
Abandoned
Sparrow’s nest

Just friends:
he watches my gauze dress
blowing on the line.

A little boy sings
on a terrace, eyes aglow.
Ridge spills upward.

Electric salsa
Glides across beans, rice and meat
dancing palate joy.

I used to date you
But now you just serve me food
One taco, no love.

Foil wrapped burrito
Is it wrong to love you so?
I don’t need a man.

lend me your arms,
fast as thunderbolts,
for a pillow on my journey.

A stone at its core,
this snowball’s the porcelain
knob on winter’s door.

an aging willow--
its image unsteady
in the flowing stream

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door

pickup couvert de boue -
quatre chiens observent
la porte de la taverne

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows--
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

midsummer morning--
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes--
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that long-ago kiss--
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

bitter cold--
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food

deepening snow--
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmed-over coffee--
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider--
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning--
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room--
books of wisdom
lean left . . . and right

turning north--
sand from both oceans
in little jars

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn

winter roses
I am tired of reading
between the lines

rainy New York
from the tenth storey window
black umbrellas bloom

drunk on the beach-
the moon in my sake cup
disappears

faintly purple
against the moon -
pines in the light

the last light of day ~
purple rhododendrons
dissolve in the dark

wisteria -
blooming before
the end of rain

through lace
the tracery of frost
on glass

rain
falls from the trees
on the blue iris

winter beach -
three grey lines
of sand, sea and sky

winter -
white peonies
in falling snow
